<p>Beautiful weather. Wind SW &amp; SSW. The Wallsend Harriers threw off at Tynemouth lodge H harry &amp; I went out to see them. Found a <span class=highlight_yellow>hade</span> in the plantation which they ran round by the dean &amp; lost in Hoggs garden. Dined at home, Gostling lunched with us. At the billiard room in the afternoon &amp; at night at the Albion &amp; with Bess</p>
