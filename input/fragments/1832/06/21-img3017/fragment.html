<p>A beautiful day. Went again to Newcastle by steam. Dined with Mr Dodds &amp; afterwards walked to the course. Poor running. Both cups won easily. The <span class=highlight_yellow>GoO</span> by Mary Cleveland &amp; the silver by Captain Potts. Returned to Mr Dodds &amp; got home by steam at 1 o'clock in the morning</p>
