<p>A dull morning. Blowing hard from the SW. Went by steam to Newcastle &amp; fixed the Hope to take coals out to <span class=highlight_yellow>Swinemsend</span> at &pound;6.6 per keel. Returned home to dinner &amp; afterwards went to Tynemouth races which were very bad. Turned out a wet day &amp; spoiled the sport.  At Bess at night</p>
