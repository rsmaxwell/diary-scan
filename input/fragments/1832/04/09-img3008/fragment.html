<p>A dull cool morning. Wind ESE. Got up at 4 o'clock &amp; went by the coach from South Shields to Stockton, got there at &frac12; past 9 o'clock. Walked to Middlesbrough &amp; saw Mr Harris about fixing the Hope. He is to send me a charter. Returned by the 2 o'clock coach &amp; got to North Shields at 8 o'clock. With Bess</p>
