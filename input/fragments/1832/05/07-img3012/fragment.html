<p>A fine morning. A fresh breeze from the WSW. The Hope's charter &amp; despatches came for Wyburg &amp; Hull at 60/ for Wades <span class=highlight_yellow>Flo</span>. Dined on board the Hope. She could not go to sea being too much swell on. Called upon <span class=highlight_yellow>Nelacd</span> the <span class=highlight_yellow>baedegream</span></p>
