<p>A fine frosty morning. Wind ESE. A slight fall of snow during the day. Walked into Newcastle with Dixon. Nothing doing on the Quay side in the way of freights, at least none to suite me. Returned to Shields in a gig. Dined at home. In the evening attended the whist club at H Dales. Received a letter from Boswell from Rye informing me he had got 90 passengers for New York</p>
