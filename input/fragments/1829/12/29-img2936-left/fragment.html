<p>A dull winters morning. Frost gone, having been rain during the night. Wind E by S but still cold.</p>
<p>Attended a meeting at the church to take into consideration the offer of the board of ordinance either to purchase the burial ground at Tynemouth or give a piece of ground in lieu of it. The meeting determined not to do either, but to let the Board apply to Parliament for an act to take it from us, which they had threatened to do. Dined at home. In the evening H Harry, H Nicolson &amp; I had a glass of grog at the George together</p>
