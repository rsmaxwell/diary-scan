<p>A frosty morning. Rather foggy. Wind WSW. Took a long walk with Captain Webb round Cullercoats, Tynemouth. Dined at home. Wrote to Boswell at <span class=highlight_yellow>Refe</span> informing him of the <span class=highlight_yellow>odesoan</span> freights being &pound;4 per ton &amp; 10 pct for <span class=highlight_yellow>tullers</span>. At the whist club &amp; with Bell Jarvis</p>
