<p>A frosty morning. Wind East. H Harry went with me on board the Hope to give me his advice with regard to the repairs. Found they had taken the broken hold beam out &amp; preparing a new one. Ordered several new <span class=highlight_yellow>kne</span><span class=highlight_yellow>e</span><span class=highlight_yellow>s</span> to be put in. Dined at home &amp; spent the evening</p>
