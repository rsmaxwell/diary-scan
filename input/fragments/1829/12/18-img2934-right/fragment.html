<p>A fine frosty morning. Wind NNW. On board the Hope. The carpenter's busy with the stern <span class=highlight_yellow>bolling</span>. The timber ends etc &amp; going to put in another hook, having finished the after <span class=highlight_yellow>raftport</span>. Drew &pound;5 cash out of Chapmans. Dined at home. Spent the evening with Allen. Paid E Reed's mother &pound;2.9 the balance of his wages. Turned out a very wet night.</p>
