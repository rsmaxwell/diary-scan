<p>A fine seasonal morning. Wind NW &amp; snowing heavy. Did not go to church. Made up the Hope's <span class=highlight_yellow>final</span> voyage in the ships <span class=highlight_yellow>log</span>. She clears nothing much to my unsurprised &amp; disappointment. Dined with H Harry. In the evening with Bell Jarvis &amp; Jane Dryden.</p>
