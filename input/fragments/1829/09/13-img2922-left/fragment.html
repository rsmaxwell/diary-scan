<p>A pleasant morning wind. Feeling exceptionally annoyed &amp; hurt by Bob Marsh's conduct, I got up early &amp; left his chambers. Indeed had it not been so late I should have done so last night. Breakfasted with William in Nottingham Place. We afterwards went to <span class=highlight_yellow>vere</span> St Chapel. In the afternoon we walked to Sloan Street &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>we</span> called at Mrs Locks to see Mary &amp; Emma. On our way home had a <span class=highlight_yellow>stroll</span> in Hyde Park. Very few people there. Vincent <span class=highlight_yellow>Fitz</span><span class=highlight_yellow>manian</span> &amp; Bob Marsh dined with us. We intended to have given the latter a hint that his company could be dispensed with, but did not, as it might have caused much unpleasantness. I determined however to tell him what I thought of his conduct, but had not an opportunity. He shall yet hear more about it. A very wet night</p>
