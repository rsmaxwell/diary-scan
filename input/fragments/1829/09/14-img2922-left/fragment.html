<p>A cloudy morning. Wind WSW. Went into the city upon a Paddington stage coach rather early, to pack a hamper of <span class=highlight_yellow>special madeira</span> up for Mr Chapman of Elseineur. J Galbraith &amp; I thence walked down to Dowson's dock to the Hope, where we dined. The people busy caulking &amp; repairing some soft places where she has been leaking. Left the ship between 4 &amp; 5 o'clock. Brought new <span class=highlight_yellow>umbrella</span></p>
