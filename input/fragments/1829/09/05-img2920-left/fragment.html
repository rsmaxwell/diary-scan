<p>A dull cloudy morning, with a slight shower or two of rain. Wind I think about WSW. Watt prevailed upon me to remain till Monday. Amused ourselves during the morning fishing for eels near Bugsby's Hole. Had poor sport, patience exhausted.  A great many large ships passed us from foreign, with some collisions. Dined at 6 o'clock &amp; in the evening played a rubber of whist</p>
