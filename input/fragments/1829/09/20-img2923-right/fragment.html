<p>A very fine morning. Wind about NNE. Got under way about 6 o'clock &amp; ran down to the <span class=highlight_yellow>Warp</span> where we brought up about &frac12; past 9 o'clock am.  Turned out an uncommonly fine day &amp; warm. About 12 o'clock the wind got to the NNW then NW &amp; after dinner to W by S &amp; WSW. When we got our anchor up, but being little wind, did not make much way. At about 8 o'clock being dark &amp; not able to see the buoy of the middle, we brought up for the night. Several ships in company.</p>
<p>At 9 o'clock smoked a pipe, wet both eyes &amp; turned in. A good deal annoyed at not being able to proceed, there being a fine breeze.</p>
