<p>A dull morning. Afterwards turned to rain. Wind SW &amp; WSW blowing strong. Engaged all the morning in the office making up the Hope's Petersburg voyage. Dined at home. Mrs S<font color=#BFBFBF>cott</font> put the question to me whether I was the cause of <font color=#0000FF>Ann</font> <font color=#BFBFBF>Maxwell </font>being with child, which on her (Mrs Scott's ) account being in so precarious a state of health, I denied.  Therefor if she hears of it through some kind officious friend &amp; anything happens, be the blame upon their shoulders. I shall not be the cause.</p>
<p>With Ann Stokes this evening</p>
<p>The Childers, Captain <span class=highlight_yellow>Moriay</span> came into harbour</p>
