<p>Been blowing a gale of wind from the NNE all night &amp; continued with rain all day. Amused ourselves during the morning strolling about Purfleet &amp; playing at billiards. Got our ballast on board &amp; hauled from the wharf about 5 o'clock. Weighed anchor &amp; sailed down to the Tower. Hope when we brought up for the night. Blowing a gale of wind. Finished a couple of glasses of whiskey punch, smoked a pipe &amp; turned in at 9 o'clock</p>
