<p>A beautiful morning. Wind about W by N. At 7 o'clock a steam boat came alongside &amp; afterwards towed us into the harbour, where Mr White &amp; I landed &amp; went up to Dockwray Square to breakfast. Found Mrs Scott much better than I expected &amp; able to get into the drawing room. Took an early dinner with Mr Tinley. Sat with <span class=highlight_yellow>neuf</span> for some time in the evening &amp; took tea with Mr Tinley.</p>
<p>Much mortified and unhappy at being informed by <font color=#0000FF>Ann</font><font color=#0070C0> </font><font color=#BFBFBF>Maxwell </font>of her being with child to me. What the end of it be, I cannot divine, but it makes me miserable that I should have been such a fool &amp; madman to have committed such an act. Such a break of hospitality, such shaming &amp; disgraceful conduct. I am ashamed of myself.</p>
