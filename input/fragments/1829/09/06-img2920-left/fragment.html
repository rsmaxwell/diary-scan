<p>A cloudy morning. Wind SSW. I accompanied Miss Watt to church, but might as well have been at home for anything I heard of the sermon. A large consignment Dined at 6 o'clock. Mr Philips. Watt's landlord dined with us. Spent a quiet evening. It began to rain soon after church &amp; continued heavy all day which confined us to the house.</p>
