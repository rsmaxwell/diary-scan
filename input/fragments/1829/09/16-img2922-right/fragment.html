<p>A very wet day &amp; been raining heavy all night. Wind NE. Took a Paddington dray to the city. Called at Chapmans &amp; agreed to take 500 staves and not more unless the master wished. The agent giving me a letter pledging himself to that effect. On the Coal Exchange nothing particular there. Did not find a ship to take me to Shields. Took a coach &amp; carried all J G's cloths down to the ship. Found her just hauled out of dock. Had some <span class=highlight_yellow>beef</span>.</p>
