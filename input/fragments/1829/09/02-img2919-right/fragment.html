<p>A fine day. Wind NW. Called upon Jobling. He drove me down to Woolwich to see the Lumley's. Eat some cold meat with them &amp; returned to the ship at Greenwich to dinner, where Tom Jobling joined us. Left the ship about 7 o'clock &amp; drove to town. Had a glass of brandy &amp; wine with Jobling &amp; got to bed at &frac12; past 10 o'clock</p>
