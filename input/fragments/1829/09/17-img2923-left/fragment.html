<p>A dull morning. Wind NE. Took a Paddington stage into the city. Stephenson up, but not cleared for want of papers relative to the sum, from the West India docks. J Galbraith &amp; I walked down to the ship. Dined on board. Got our ballast alongside. Put all my cloths etc. on board the Peggy, captain Hunter, intending to take my passage to Shields in her. She hauled out of the Regents Canal &amp; proceeded down the river to Purfleet to ballast. William &amp; I walked up to the city, calling at Chapmans respecting the clearing papers.</p>
