<p>A fine morning. Wind NW. Bob Marsh &amp; I walked into the city &amp; thence on board the Hope where we dined. The people busy getting the tallow out. Returned to Philpot Lane where we stopped until 6 o'clock with Mary Ann first time. Walked out of the city to chambers &amp; remained all evening. Received a letter from William which came yesterday. Did not answer it.</p>
