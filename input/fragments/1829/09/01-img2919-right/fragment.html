<p>A dull day &amp; showery. Walked into the city &amp; down to the docks. Found them employed in moving the ship to a birth &amp; then began to deliver her cargo before I left. Went to <span class=highlight_yellow>cha</span><span class=highlight_yellow>mbers</span> &amp; afterwards walked westward. Dined with Jobling in the Adelphi, only ourselves. Spent a pleasant day. Got rather too much wine. Slept all night in Villiers Street</p>
