<p>Finer weather. Wind about SW. Nothing particular occurred today. Attended chambers. Sam Harry offered me 21/- <span class=highlight_yellow>pload</span> for Hull, having had a letter from Henry, that such freights could be obtained. Agreed to wait till tomorrow when Henry would be in town. Walked to the Blue Ports in Cork Square where we all met &amp; dined.</p>
