<p>A dull showery day. Wind W by N. Went by a Paddington dray into the city. Stephenson called at the office having got his dispatches. Surprised to find that Chapmans had given him a copy of a charter which did not agree with that I signed, having <span class=highlight_yellow>Stavers</span> introduced. Called at <span class=highlight_yellow>Color's</span> office &amp; saw the original charter &amp; found it <span class=highlight_yellow>outlined</span>. Exceedingly surprised &amp; angry that such a thing should be done without my knowledge or sanction &amp; the more surprised that Chapmans should permit it. A most unjustifiable act, nay worse. Walked down to the ship, the people getting on very well or it seem to be giving her a good caulking. Dined on board. J Galbraith &amp; I walked home by Fleet Street, Regent Street etc...</p>
