<p>A dull morning. Wind N by W &amp; cold. Received a letter from C Richmond asking me to go to <span class=highlight_yellow>Bur</span><span class=highlight_yellow>nhopeside</span> tomorrow. Answered it &amp; fixed Sunday to be there. Dined at home &amp; in the afternoon took a walk with Mark Webb &amp; Mr Robinson, the latter with his <span class=highlight_yellow>guardian</span></p>
