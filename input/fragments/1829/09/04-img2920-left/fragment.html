<p>Another fine day. Wind the same. Bob &amp; I again walked into the city &amp; to the Hope where we lunched. Got all the tallow out today &amp; expect to deliver the copper. Returned to Philpot Lane where I met with Mr James Gale from Carlow. With Maryann again. Took a Greenwich boat at the tower Stairs &amp; went down to Watts, where I dined &amp; stayed all night.</p>
