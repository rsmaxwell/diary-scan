<p>A fine morning. Wind NW William, J Galbraith called at the New Inn &amp; I walked into the city with them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we got upon a Paddington stage &amp; went up to Nottingham Place &amp; thence to the Zoological gardens, which are much improved. Dined at 6 o'clock with Mr R Chapman in <span class=highlight_yellow>John Street</span>, Bedford Row. Mr Hancock, Mr Graham &amp; another gentleman there. Spent a very pleasant day.</p>
<p>On my return to chambers found Bob marsh reading. Asked him to allow me to remain in his chambers for the few days I stopped in town, but much to my surprise he refused, which hurt me not a little. After living nearly three months with me on board the Hope. It was doing me but a trifling favour &amp; without either inconveniencing or expense to himself, I could not have expected &amp; I know not how he could possibly make his mind up to treat me with so much unkindness. However I shall not forget it in a hurry. I pronounce him to be a mean and shabby fellow</p>
