<p>A showery day, at intervals, at intervals very fine. Wind about SE. Got into a Greenwich boat at &frac12; past 10 o'clock &amp; landed at Catherine dock. Found them busy with the <span class=highlight_yellow>lathwood</span> which was sold on Thursday to Mr Martin at &pound;16.5/- a fathom. Had not been long on board when Bob Marsh came. We had our dinner &amp; afterwards walked up to Philpot lane where I found a letter from William of his intention to be in town by the Highflyer in the evening.</p>
<p>Called at J Chapmans &amp; from the state of the coal trades, the coal owners having again restricted the <span class=highlight_yellow>vends</span>, raised their price 5/- &amp; refusing either to freight or uphold, I almost determined to send the Hope to <span class=highlight_yellow>memel</span> at 21/- &amp; load for timber. Shall settle tomorrow.</p>
<p>Bob &amp; I called upon J Hodgsons &amp; afterwards took a walk up Regent Street. Brought a new Hat at Oliphants &amp; a pair of trousers at Laffins. At &frac12; past 8 o'clock went to the Cock in Fleet Street &amp; eat some oysters &amp; at 10 o'clock met William &amp; Lea at the White Horse in Fetter Lane having just arrived from Shields by the Highflyer. A very wet night</p>
