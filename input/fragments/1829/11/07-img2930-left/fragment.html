<p>A most beautiful morning. Wind NW. The air rather frosty. Intended going to Newcastle with H Harry but prevented by a most disturbing letter from captain Stephenson of the Hope dated <i>Elsinore</i><i> </i>the 24<sup>th</sup> Oct informing me of the loss of poor J Galbraith. He having fallen overboard from the maintop sail yard when reefing pitching upon the top in his fall, poor fellow, his career has been short but &lsquo;tis all for the best. I hope he has left a world of misery &amp; is now I trust happy with his dear parents. Remained in the house all day in consequence of this sad news. Wrote to WBS, Mr Vernon &amp; D Dixon</p>
