<p>Another cloudy morning. Wind NE. Walked into the city. Called upon Bob Marsh. He &amp; his father walked with me down to the Hope. Saw the St Catherine Docks in our way &amp; the most perfect &amp; comfortable perhaps of thing of the sort all the warehouses &amp; upon so good a place. Had lunch on board &amp; I afterwards attended changes but did nothing for the ship. Walked out of the city with Inspector Chapman &amp; dined with him. His brothers the captain, Thomas, Ben, Mr Graham &amp; a Mr Day there.</p>
