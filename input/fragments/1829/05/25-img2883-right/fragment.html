<p>A fine morning, but blowing hard from the N by E. William &amp; I walked into the city. Called upon Bob Marsh only a short time at the office, when Stephenson brought Ann up. I walked with her to Grays Inn, showed her St Pants, went round by Oxford &amp; Regents street &amp; Ann feet being very sore we after buying a pair of easy shoes, took a coach &amp; drove to  new inn. Dined with Bob Marsh &amp; afterwards we all went to the pit at Covent garden Theatre. Ann much astonished at the size &amp; splendour of the houses. We saw Romeo &amp; Juliet performed by C Kenneth &amp; Mrs Smithson. Then afterwards the Devils Elixir, not worth seeing. Ann &amp; I slept at the Fountain in Catherine Street</p>
