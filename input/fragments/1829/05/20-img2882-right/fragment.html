<p>A beautiful morning. Wind NE. Turned out a 8 o'clock am. The ship off Robin Hoods but the ebb tide &amp; heavy SE swell setting against us drove us <span class=highlight_yellow>back</span> to Whitby. In the afternoon with the <span class=highlight_yellow>fload</span> a better breeze spring up &amp; set us ahead again &amp; 10 o'clock pm bed time, we were off Scarborough. A fine moonlit night.</p>
