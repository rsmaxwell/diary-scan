<p>Got up at 8 o'clock am. Very thick weather, but a fine breeze at NE, then appeared to be off Yarmouth behind the sands. We ran until about 1 o'clock pm when we took in studding sails &amp; stood in for the land, which we made a little to the northward of Aldeburgh. The weather clearer from thence. We took our departure to run down <span class=highlight_yellow>raren</span> . About 4 o'clock it turned out a beautiful clear day. At 6 o'clock pm abreast of Orford. At 10 pm being dark, brought up abreast of the Hook of the middle. At a little after 12 o'clock went to bed. A fine moonlit night. With Ann Stokes again!!</p>
