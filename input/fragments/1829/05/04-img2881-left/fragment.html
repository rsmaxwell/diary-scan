<p>A pleasant morning. But still blowing hard from the NW. Amused ourselves for a short time in the plantations with the beagles. Mrs Dixon took us into Newcastle in the carriage. Tom Smith transacted his business there &amp; we afterwards walked down to St Anthon's to see a sloop he had purchased for his colliery. Returned to Shields by steam to dinner.</p>
