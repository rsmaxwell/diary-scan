I should also mention that before the ship got to the mole, party of customs house officers came on board &amp; immediately scaled down all the hatches&amp; everything on board in the shape of a trunk or parcel belonging to us as passengers. The masters &amp; crew's trunks &amp; cabin lockers &amp; draws being <span class=highlight_yellow>examined</span>, the seals to <span class=highlight_yellow>re</span><span class=highlight_yellow>m</span><span class=highlight_yellow>a</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ce</span><span class=highlight_yellow>r</span> upon the <span class=highlight_yellow>karabis</span> until the collector came on board to search the ship.</p>
<p>In the evening we walked about the town which is perfectly good for the plaice &amp; the fort exceedingly strong being covered with cannons &amp; having a garrison. I know not of how many men. I should think not numerous. The mole where the merchants vessels lay is a fine reservoir or wet dock capable of containing several hundred ships &amp; water enough for them to take in the whole of their cargos. There is also another mole for the men-of-war. We strolled about the town the whole of the evening &amp; when we looked at our watches much to our astonishment we found at nearly 12 o'clock  &amp; quite day light. In fact it is light all night here in summer. We returned to the ship, had our glass of spirit &amp; water &amp; turned in.</p>
