<p>... all necessary business. Bob &amp; I remained on board all day, expecting the collector every hour to search the ship &amp; independently of which the heat was so great that we did not feel much <span class=highlight_yellow>despaired</span> to move. We got an awning  <span class=highlight_yellow>aerown</span> over the main boom &amp; kept ourselves as cool as we could. The collector did not come on board until 6 o'clock in the evening, a pompous, haughty Russian &amp; like all the rest, lazy &amp; will not move an inch out of the way to <span class=highlight_yellow>seron</span> anyone. I find there is a very bad feeling at present towards the English. He or rather his officers searched the ship, but put his seals upon the hatches again. <span class=highlight_yellow>F</span><span class=highlight_yellow>or</span> packages he did not search, only counted them &amp; ordered his officers  on board not to take them off till the morning when people might deliver the ballast.</p>

In every shop there is a panting or <span class=highlight_yellow>fr</span><span class=highlight_yellow>e</span><span class=highlight_yellow>sc</span><span class=highlight_yellow>o</span> of our saviour or the virgin &amp; in various parks of the town were erections in which was placed what they intended I suppose to be representations of our saviour &amp; the virgin or some saint decked out in a most ridiculous style with <span class=highlight_yellow>linsel</span>. They were the most hideous likenesses to the human face that <span class=highlight_yellow>there</span> could be. Before each was a <span class=highlight_yellow>candle</span> which was kept constantly burning &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>how</span> every one of the poor ignorant devils on payment stopped crossing themselves, bowing &amp; seeming to repeat ...</p>
