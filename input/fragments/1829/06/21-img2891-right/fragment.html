<p>Turned out at &frac12; 7 o'clock. Found the ship still in sight of Falsterbo, having been working to windward all night &amp; made but little progress, <span class=highlight_yellow>wind</span> fast. After breakfast read the service &amp; lessons of the day. Just before I got upon deck, the XYZ passed us homeward bound, with a fine breeze &amp; studdingsails set. We continued working to westward the whole of the day. At 9 o'clock took our gin &amp; water &amp; went to bed.</p>
