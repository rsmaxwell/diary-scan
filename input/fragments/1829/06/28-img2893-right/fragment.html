<p>Turned out a little before 8 o'clock. Found the ship abreast of Revala distant perhaps from 15 to 20 miles. Last night fine clear weather with light breezes. This a most delightful morning with a continuance of fair wind at WSW. Course east. At 10 o'clock the Island of Kokskar within 4 miles abreast of us. Upon it a lighthouse 99 feet high. Going five knots, breeze freshening. All the morning have been going 5 &amp; 6 knots with most delightful weather. The ship sailing remarkably fast &amp; passing <span class=highlight_yellow>everything</span> in company.</p>
<p>At &frac14; past 5 o'clock pm saw the Island of Gogland right ahead, distant about 20 miles &amp; at 8 o'clock passed close under the north end of the island which has a most beautiful appearance being exceedingly high and mountainous &amp; mainly covered with the spruce pine excepting in some spots when you see the rock , it is itself in fact one huge rock, not a particle of earth to be seen &amp; producing only the now about mentioned a well as we could judge by looking through the glass &amp; we were within a mile of it considerably. This island is about 6 miles long &amp; forms a fine breakwater to the NE end of the gulf of Finland. For after we passed it we found the sea quite smooth. On the highest part of the island there is a lighthouse which can be seen at the distance of 12 miles &amp; also another on the extreme N<font color=#BFBFBF>orthern</font> point, round which is the best channel for ships.</p>
<p>At &frac12; past 8 o'clock Bob, Stephenson &amp; I punished a couple of glasses of rum and water each, being rather a cool night &amp; likely the last. Turned in at 10 o'clock. Bob &amp; I each to a sketch of the island of Gogland which we flatter ourselves we shall make very interesting.</p>
<p>This evening going 7 knots.</p>
