<p>At a little after 12 o'clock last night the wind suddenly took us all aback &amp; hearing dome noise upon deck, went up the companion ladder &amp; found there busy getting studdingsails in &amp; being only in my shirt as I turned out, I think I caught cold &amp; slight attack of rheumatism in my loin. During the remainder of the night it was quite calm with heavy thunder &amp; lightening &amp; toward morning tremendous heavy rain which with the rheumatism &amp; having had little sleep, prevented me getting up to breakfast. I however turned out immediately after &amp; was happy to find the wind had become fair for us being NNE, steering an easterly course, with studdingsails set, but only going about 3 knots. Several ships in company.</p>

Since diner a better breeze has sprung up &amp; we have been going 4 &amp; 5 knots.</p>
