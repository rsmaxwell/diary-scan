<p>Got up at 8 o'clock. A beautiful morning &amp; exceptionally hot. Found a great many Shields ships laying in the mole amongst them the Gordeson, Cholmley, the Wellington, H Daeghton &amp; &amp; Bob Marsh &amp; I went on board &amp; had our breakfast with H Deyghtow &amp; his wife. The master &amp; J Galbraith went on shore early to Mr Booker to report the ship &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>vansack</span></p>
