<p>... sails set. Perfectly astonished at the exceeding beauty of the coast, so finely wooded &amp; rich. &lsquo;tis impossible to imagine scenery more splendid.</p>
<p>At &frac12; past 6 o'clock am came to an anchor in Copenhagen roads about &frac34; of a mile from the entrance to the harbour. Dressed ourselves &amp; got on shore about &frac12; past 7 o'clock. The mouth of the harbour is protected by a story battery (an island) called the Crown Battery, on both sides of which vessels can pass in, but on that side next to  <span class=highlight_yellow>Elscaeur</span> is the deepest water. We were obliged to stop at a platform where the <span class=highlight_yellow>Zuarantan</span> Officer is on the right hand side after passing the battery, where after being asked several questions, we were given a pass without which we should not have been allowed to land. The expense of this is one dollar for each person on board. Equal to about 2/3 a <span class=highlight_yellow>p</span><span class=highlight_yellow>r</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ice</span>.</p>
<p>Upon landing, we were <span class=highlight_yellow>a</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ssisted</span> by a person who proved to be <span class=highlight_yellow>Mr</span> Chapman's agent at Copenhagen.

From him we also met with much <span class=highlight_yellow>pontificating</span>. At 8 o'clock went to the Hotel D'Angleterre &amp; had our breakfast &amp; afterwards proceeded, accompanied by a clerk of Mr Ryan, a very intelligent young Dame who talked English fluently. Arrived <span class=highlight_yellow>at</span> the town by the ramparts. As our time would not allow us to see much more than the town itself, but with it we were as touched &amp; delighted without exception. Taking it all together, it is the most beautiful city I ever saw. Most of cities have their S<sup>t</sup> Gales Bellengales &amp; but here there does not appear to be anything of the sort. &lsquo;tis all alike most ...</p>
