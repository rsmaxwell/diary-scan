<p>... we did see of the town, we were much pleased with. The houses are good and exceedingly neat &amp; clean inside &amp; out &amp; the inhabitants appeared to be a very respectable orderly set of people.</p>
<p>Bob, JnoG <font color=#BFBFBF>[John G</font><font color=#BFBFBF>a</font><font color=#BFBFBF>l</font><font color=#BFBFBF>braith] </font>&amp; I took a stroll even in the rain &amp; found our way into the church, where we remained some time. There was a large assemblage of children who were undergoing some examination by their chargeman. He appeared to be <span class=highlight_yellow>ca</span><span class=highlight_yellow>j</span><span class=highlight_yellow>oling</span> them, hard a great deal, but undeserved not a word that we saw, so came away as wise as we went. The alter was very splendidly ornamented &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>the</span> whole had a very grand imposing effect.</p>
<p>The Captain was employed during the morning purchasing such stores as the ship required.</p>
<p>At &frac12; past 1 o'clock pm we sat down to dinner &amp; were very hospitably entertained by W Chapman &amp; his father, too much so could, for we got rather too much wine &amp; I found myself pretty well <span class=highlight_yellow>s</span><span class=highlight_yellow>crew</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ed</span> by the time (5 or 6 o'clock) we had to go on bord again.</p>
<p>Reached the ship at about &frac12; past 5 o'clock taking our pilot off with  us with the intention of getting under way &amp; running down to Copenhagen road, but it <font color=#BFBFBF>[was</font><font color=#BFBFBF>]</font> blowing a gale of wind, as it had been all day. &amp; having a foul birth from the number of ships. Lying about us, we could not get our anchor excepting at the risk of doing damage, so we determined to lay still until the wind abated.</p>
<p>Between 9 &amp; 10 o'clock turned in for the night.</p>
