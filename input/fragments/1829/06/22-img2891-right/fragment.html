<p>A continuance of fine weather but wind still from the east &amp; rather cool. Towards the afternoon the wind gradually decreased &amp; became much warmer, so that we are in hope it will die away &amp; shall have a change. This working to windward in the Baltic is much more tiresome than anywhere else. The current also being always against you. In the evening became quite calm. At 9 o'clock took our tumbler of whisky toddy &amp; went to bed. The Swedish coast very fine &amp; pretty, well wooded.</p>
