<p>During the night it has blown a steady breeze, fair for us &amp; we have gone along steadily &amp; pleasant at about the rate of 6 knots. After a good snooze, turned out at &frac12; past 7 o'clock. A most delightful morning. Not a cloud to be seen, with a find steady &amp; refreshing breeze from SW by W. Steady sails still continued set. After breakfast read the morning service &amp; lessons. Passed through a large fleet of Dutch fishing boats, many of them came near &amp; wished us much to buy some fish. Dined between 12 &amp; 1 o'clock &amp; Bob &amp; I punished another bottle of Madeira. Only one more left, which we have determined, if possible, to keep for next Sunday. We have not averaged this day more than 4 knots an hour.</p>
<p>Started a ENE course. The master &amp; mate at 12 o'clock took their observation on latitude 53.8 North Long 3.30. Distance from the Sunk, run since 6 last evening 111 miles. Changed our course to NE.</p>
<p>At 9 o'clock took our rum &amp; water &amp; afterwards being a most beautiful moonlit night, we walked the deck for &frac12; an hour &amp; at &frac12; past 10 o'clock turned in, at which time we had a better breeze &amp; had increased our rate to about 6 knots.</p>
