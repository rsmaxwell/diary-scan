<p>... devoting four hours on certain days in the week to passing any complaints or receiving petitions, which he does from the parties themselves, not as with our King through a minister which by the bye I think the proper way, the King of Denmark makes himself too common in the respect though he constantly attains his object, the love of his people. He keeps up very little state and presumably the city the same as any private individual without any attendant. We did not see him. He &amp; the family being at their country residence in Jutland.</p>
<p>At &frac12; past 11 o'clock am returned to Mr Ryan's  extremely heated &amp; rather tired with our walk &amp; after refreshing ourselves with a glass of his good medicine &amp; water &amp; thanking him for his attention, we got into our boat &amp; again embarked at about 12 o'clock. Whilst the crew were getting the anchor up, Bob, <span class=highlight_yellow>Inspector</span> G &amp; I undressed, jumped overboard &amp; had a most delightful bath. By the time we had got on board again the ship was under way, with the wind at SE, not very favourable for us. After making two or three boards, blowing by this time, a fresh breeze, we go through the grounds &amp; at 3 o'clock the pilot left us between the islands of Saltholm &amp; Drag&oslash;r, the extreme point of Jutland. Met a fleet of loaded vessels running down to Elslnem at 5 o'clock pm. Passed Falsterbo on the starboard tack, close hauled, wind about ESE. At &frac14; past 8 o'clock tacked Moen Island bearing SW distant about 6 miles. A clear frosty looking sky, wind, current &amp; heavy swell against us &amp; no appearance of a change this night. At 9 o'clock Bob and I took one glass of comfort &amp; went to bed.</p>
