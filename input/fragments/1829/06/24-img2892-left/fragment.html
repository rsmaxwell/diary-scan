<p>Turned out at 8 o'clock after a sound snooze. After a dead calm, the whole of the night, at 6 o'clock this morning a breeze sprung up from NW &amp; when we got upon deck, found we were gradually loosing slight of the island. Got studding sails set, but not at any time going more than four knots, sometimes not so much.</p>
<p>Most beautiful weather, but the sun not so scorching as yesterday. Accompanied the whole day by thousands of large dragon flies that flew about &amp; alighted upon our rigging which was at times covered with them. At &frac12; past 8 o'clock, went below &amp; had our rum &amp; water &amp; when we went to bed at &frac12; past 9 o'clock, the wind continued favourable &amp; a fine breeze.</p>
