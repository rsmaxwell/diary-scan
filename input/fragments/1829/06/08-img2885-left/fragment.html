<p>A dull morning. Wind NW. A good deal of rain after a breakfast. Walked into the city. Brought a filtering machine for the ship. Gave Stephenson &pound;25.  Settled the freight account with William &amp; received the balance &pound;30.4/-. Called at the Russian consul for passports.  Dined at Richmonds. Hard J Jobling Chambers &amp; there. When I got home, found J Gilbraith had arrived.</p>
