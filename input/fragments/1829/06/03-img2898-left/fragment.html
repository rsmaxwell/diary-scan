<p>... upon one of which, <span class=highlight_yellow>Yelagin</span>. We landed &amp; walked through the plantations, the walk of which are beautiful, in good order &amp; under the management of an English <span class=highlight_yellow>Lumana</span> &amp; and attached to a very fine palace of the Emperor that stands close to the water. Near it is a bridge which we crossed to the opposite Island of <span class=highlight_yellow>Kam</span><span class=highlight_yellow>enny</span>, at the end is a handsome theatre, placed there to be near this summer retreat of the Emperor's. This is a very fashionable theatre &amp; attended principally by the court, but I believe open to all. Here they perform French, Italian &amp; German operas. These islands are the property of the Emperor &amp; noblemen. The grounds most beautifully laid out &amp; always open to the public. The Russians being much more <span class=highlight_yellow>ce</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ri</span><span class=highlight_yellow>bal</span> in this respect than John Bull. They delight in seeing the people strolling about the grounds &amp; have seats placed in all directions for their accommodation. We then proceeded through these fairy grounds to the island of <span class=highlight_yellow>Kres</span><span class=highlight_yellow>tovsky</span> Island where Mr Dye has a cottage for the summer. Here we took tea with his family &amp; late in the evening returned to Petersburg which we did not reach till after 1 o'clock in the morning exceptionally tired with our walk</p>
