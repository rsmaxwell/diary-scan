<p>After a regular good &amp; sound snooze, turned out at &frac12; past 7 o'clock.</p>
<p>During the night slight shower with very little wind. To our great joy when we looked up through the cabin sky light, we saw the yards square &amp; studding sails set. Wind WNW. After breakfast &amp; commenced a heavy rain, which continued until 12 o'clock. Saw the <span class=highlight_yellow>Shaw</span> light at 2 o'clock.</p>
<p>Employed myself in painting the ship's name upon the skiff &amp; the carpenter finishing painting the underside. Bob Marsh being too lazy to complete his work.</p>
<p>Wind continuing favourable &amp; a fine fresh breeze going 5 or 6 knots. At 9 o'clock saw the <span class=highlight_yellow>Trindlew</span> &amp; the island of <span class=highlight_yellow>Lcefsoe</span> bearing NW by W, distant 5 or 6 miles.</p>
<p>Took our warm glass of brandy &amp; water &amp; got to bed before 10 o'clock. <span class=highlight_yellow>Looking</span> the sea evidently rising.</p>
