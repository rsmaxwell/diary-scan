<p>A little before 5 o'clock seeing it very black to windward &amp; a squall coming, stowed <span class=highlight_yellow>t</span><span class=highlight_yellow>o</span><span class=highlight_yellow>p</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>galla</span><span class=highlight_yellow>n</span><span class=highlight_yellow>d</span> sails &amp; lowered topsails upon the <span class=highlight_yellow>Cep</span> just as the squall took us, very heavy, but little rain. It lasted about &frac14; of an hour. Got topsails hoisted again single reefed. Wind seemed much inclined to change. At one time we had it to our great delight from the westward where we squared our yards, but to our inexpressible annoyance had scarcely done when it returned to the old quarter.</p>
<p>During this evening a large fleet of loaded vessels upwards of 80 sail from the Baltic passed us as we let out both reefs. Walked the deck until 10 o'clock when we had our glass of comfort &amp; turned in. Little wind from about the south</p>
