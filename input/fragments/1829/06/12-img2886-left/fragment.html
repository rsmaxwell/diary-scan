<p>Got up at 7 o'clock. Every appearance of being a very after a thick foggy night. Wind about East. After breakfast Bob Marsh &amp; I went on shore to endeavour to get each a straw hat, but did not succeed. Returned to the ship again before 10 o'clock. During our absence they had got her under way. At low water having had a fresh breeze from the E to ESE. We brought up abreast of Canvey Island, off Leigh at &frac12; past 2 o'clock. Had our dinner which <span class=highlight_yellow>was</span> devoured with a pretty considerable appetite.  Bob &amp; I punished another bottle of Madeira. Took tea at 7 o'clock and at 9 o'clock again got underway with a light breeze <span class=highlight_yellow>from about</span> SSE which carried us down to Southend when  we let go our anchor for the night at &frac12; past 10 o'clock. <span class=highlight_yellow>Discharged</span> a couple of glasses of rum &amp; water &amp; turned in at &frac14; to 12 o'clock. Quite ready for a good snooze.</p>
<p>Should the wind continue from the eastward our intention is to go on shore &amp; spend the day at Southend.</p>
