<p>I woke a little after 5 o'clock this morning by the crew preparing to get underway, the wind having changed to the westward, so that our intentions of going on shore at Southend has been frustrated. Turned out at &frac12; past 7 o'clock. The ship not much below Southend there being scarcely enough wind to set us against the tide. A most beautiful morning &amp; exceedingly hot. Passed the Earl Balcarras Indiaman homeward bound. A very fine vessel  &amp; also a 74 foot ship at anchor above the <span class=highlight_yellow>Hove</span> Light. Several smaller vessels principally foreigners. Mr Has Venson <span class=highlight_yellow>proceed &amp;</span> <span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>be</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>d_d</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span>to them. In company with us. A beautiful sight, the sea as smooth as oil. At 10 o'clock am driving with the tide, a dead calm. Fear we shall make but a had tide work. The wind seems much incined to get round to the eastward again. About 10 o'clock a little below the Nou Light, the wind took us all aback, changing to the ESE. After making a few tacks, we increased to a fine breeze &amp; we proceeded down <span class=highlight_yellow>wind</span> gradually increasing our rate to about 7 knots an hour. At &frac14; to 5 &amp; 6 o'clock pm. Passed the <span class=highlight_yellow>Suak</span> Light. We have had a most glorious day, exceptionally hot &amp; singing our <span class=highlight_yellow>phizogs</span> in grand style. Bob &amp; I again <span class=highlight_yellow>dispatched</span> a bottle of Maderia after dinner upon deck. If we go on at this rate, I reckon our stock of wine (originally only &frac12; dozen) will only last three days longer. Today we dined at a little after 12 o'clock sea hours. Employed during the morning in preparing our fishing gear. My cold worse this evening &amp; felt exceedingly chilly. Took a stiff glass of warm rum &amp; water &amp; went to bed. Set steering sails</p>
