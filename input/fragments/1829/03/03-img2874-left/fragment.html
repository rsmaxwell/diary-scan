<p>A very fine morning. Wind NW. Went by steam to Newcastle. Nothing to be done for the Hope. Dined with Dixon Dixon. In the evening went to the theatre. Met the  <span class=highlight_yellow>Ildestons</span> there. A very thin house. The high sheriffs benefit. The Dixons &amp; Tom &amp; Bell Smith went to a ball given by the offices of the dragoon quarter at Newcastle.</p>
