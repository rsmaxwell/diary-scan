<p>A fine morning &amp; blowing fresh from the SW &amp; cold. Another large fleet coming in. Borrowed off Robert &pound;5. On board the Hope. Two keels alongside. People engaged <span class=highlight_yellow>lending</span> sails. Walked up to the spout/<span class=highlight_yellow>huroonaschs</span> &amp; took lunch on board the 3 Brothers with A French, H Harry, Allen, W Harrison, J Wright there. Dined with J Tinley a party &amp; in the evening went to the ball which was thinly attended but a very pleasant one.</p>
