<p>A damp morning. Showers of rain &amp; blowing fresh from SSW. Attended a meeting of the parishioners at the church respecting the burial ground at Tynemouth. The board of ordinance having given orders that no more interments shall take place. A most arbitrary &amp; unjust proceeding &amp; which the parish considers they have no right to do, it having been the parish church &amp; ground for time immemorial. Dined with Mr Allen &amp; afterward went on board the Hope. Got six more keels on board today. In the evening at the whist club. Paid Geo Slops &pound;1.13/- the balance of years wages account.</p>
