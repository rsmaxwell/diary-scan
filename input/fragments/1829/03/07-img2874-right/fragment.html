<p>A pleasant morning. Wind NW. Went by coach to Newcastle but evening continues very dull &amp; could do nothing for the Hope. An immense number of people at Newcastle, having been to see the unfortunate woman <span class=highlight_silver>Jane </span><span class=highlight_silver>Jameson</span> hanged for the murder of her mother. Returned home by steam to dinner. Attended the whist club at J Dale's. Met Jane Thompson for the first time at Jenny Maxwells</p>
