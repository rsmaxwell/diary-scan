<p>A very thick wet disagreeable morning, been raining nearly all night, but thank God, with a fine fresh breeze from the eastward. The ship making good way passed the north end of Hogsland this morning at 6 o'clock. Continued raining all day from 5 &frac12; to 6 &frac12; knots. When we went to bed at a little before 10 o'clock we were abreast of Revel, still blowing fresh from the East. </p>
