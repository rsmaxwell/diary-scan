During this time Stephenson was on shore buying Calkwood for broken stowage, which I have determined to load upon my own account, the freights here for it being low. After tea, wrote a letter to William to go buy some vessel bound to London &amp; then we took our usual evening's lounger about the town, had our grog &amp; went to bed</p>
