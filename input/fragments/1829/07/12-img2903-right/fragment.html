<p>After breakfast walked to the Roman Catholic Chapel to hear the singing which was very fair. A great many people there. Bob &amp; I perfectly disgusted at the superstition of both the Catholic Religion, their bowings, protestation &amp; kissing the feet * <span class=highlight_yellow>gassment</span> of the different saints. In the ceremonies &amp; forms they do not appear to differ much.</p>
<p>Dined today with Mr Wishaw at his house on the <span class=highlight_yellow>Wybury</span> Island. We were nearly an hour after our time, Mr Wishaw very stupidly not having given us proper directions to enable us to find his house out. After dinner accompanied the ladies in a boat to the opposite side of the river. Unfortunately we were late &amp; could not use the hothouse. They seem to be expensive. Here was a military band &amp; a good deal of company.</p>
