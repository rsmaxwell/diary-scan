<p>A rainy morning. Cleared up about 10 o'clock. Dressed ourselves &amp; went on shore to the English Church, just in time to hear the communion service &amp; sermon. Dined on board at 1 o'clock. Had a good sea pie &amp; some roast mutton, which enjoyed much. In the afternoon went on shore, excepting Bob, took some mead to cool us, a very agreeable &amp; refreshing drink made of honey &amp; ginger, not unlike ginger wine. Looked at the <span class=highlight_yellow>Neger</span> market, a very curious and busy scene, crowded with people bargaining &amp; selling. A great many sailors there, regular jacks, very amusing to hear them. Went in the evening to the gardens, which are open to the public on a Sunday. The walks are very prettily laid out &amp; shaded with young trees. A great many of the fashionables of Cronstat where promenading &amp; an excellent military band played for about a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Got on board early</p>
