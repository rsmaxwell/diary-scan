<p>A fine morning. Could not get to Peterhoff without our papers, which Stephenson required to clear the ship. <span class=highlight_yellow>Stayed</span> to give it up. Dined on board the David. Turned out a rainy afternoon. Came down in torrents. Engaged to take tea with Mr Ross but the rain prevented us. Did not leave the ship. </p>
