<p>A beautiful morning, but exceptionally hot. The wind having got round to the north &amp; an appearance of changing. We after breakfast hauled out of the mole but being quite calm were obliged to get a boat ahead &amp; toe the ship down to the guard ship. Cleared at the guard ship about 12 o'clock &amp; proceeded with a leading wind, but little of it.</p>
