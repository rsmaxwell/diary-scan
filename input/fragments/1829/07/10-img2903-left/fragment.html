<p>The weather still continues particularly fine. Did not go out this morning till after 11 o'clock when Bob &amp; I went to the <span class=highlight_yellow>Aliex</span> officer for our permit of residence for which we each had to pay 10 rubbles. We then went to the museum where we saw a great variety of minerals <span class=highlight_yellow>surgeal</span> preparations, stuffed animals of all sorts, a number of things in ivory beautifully turned, with the lathes all the workmanship of Peter the Great.</p>
<p>Dined with Mr Dye where we met a Mr Atkinson, Mr Bush &amp; Mr Linsey. Mr Dye kindly asked us to dine with him again at his country house that we might see some fete that is to take place in the neighbourhood. Left Mr Dye's early being foreign port night. Took a stroll with Mr Lindsey &amp; called upon a friend of his. Got home a little after 10 o'clock, finished a glass of grog &amp; went to bed</p>
