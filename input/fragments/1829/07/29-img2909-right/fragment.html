<p>Turned out this morning at &frac12; past 7 o'clock. Weather changed being quite calm, the alterations took place last night at 12 o'clock with heavy rain, thunder &amp; lightning, which &amp; I did not hear being on a very comfortable <font color=#BFBFBF>birth </font>&amp; sound asleep. In the course of the morning, when off Hanger Head, the wind got to the north (at 2 o'clock wind east) enabling us again to set studding sails, steering a WSW course.</p>
<p>Amused myself all day in reading Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle. Turned in at 11 o'clock after having our grog. Little wind.</p>
