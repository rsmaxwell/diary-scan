<p>A fine morning, rather dull. The ship working windward, the wind having unfortunately changed during the night direct against us being west. Continued <span class=highlight_yellow>binting</span> about all day without making any way. For little to the eastward of Seascar Island. In the evening we again got a leading wind &amp; before bed time, getting more to the northward, we were enabled to set lower fore &amp; topmast &amp; studding sails with a fine fresh breeze</p>
