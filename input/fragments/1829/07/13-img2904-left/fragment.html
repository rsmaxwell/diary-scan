On our way home seeing painted over something like cellars &quot;English Wind cellar&quot; &amp; fancying them to be upon the same plan as the Shades in London, we walked in, being very thirsty with the head &amp; ordered some Madeira. We presently suspected that the gentleman was a Wine Merchant &amp; would have come out again, but he desiring us to walk into his office put a bottle of very fine wine before us, which we made a hole in. We then would have paid him for it, but he would not allow us, said he perceived we were strangers &amp; was extremely happy to see us. He was exceedingly polite &amp; kind indeed. But we were certainly placed in an unpleasant predicament.</p>
<p>Mr Lindsey, Bartholomew, Bob &amp; I at 5 o'clock took a donkey &amp; drove out to Mr Dye's country house where we dined &amp; in the evening went to the <span class=highlight_yellow>Gel</span><span class=highlight_yellow>agin</span> Palace to see the grand f&ecirc;te, it being the Emperor's birthday &amp; such a scene I never beheld. Crowds of people &amp; carriages innumerable, the walks &amp; roads were literally choked up with them. Bands playing &amp; singing. All sorts of national music. Five works which we could not see very well for the crowd. The river also had a very gay &amp; animated appearance, being covered with boats filled with people in their best holiday dresses. This fate takes place in the grounds attached to the Palace which altogether is a most beautiful place. We did not arrive at our lodgings until 1 o'clock in the morning.</p>
