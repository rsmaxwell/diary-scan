<p>... arrived before 12 o'clock. Had to take our luggage again to the Customs House to be searched. A mere matter of form, for they only opened the boxes without turning the things over &amp; after a little trouble &amp; delay, we were allowed to carry all on board, accompanied by an officer. Employed ourselves during this afternoon in stowing our traps away &amp; putting everything in order.</p>
<p>After tea the captain, Marsh &amp; I went on shore, called at the butchers &amp; baker &amp; spent the remainder of the evening at a friend's where we had some wine. Got on board again between 11 &amp; 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Taken 250 casks of tallow on board</p>
