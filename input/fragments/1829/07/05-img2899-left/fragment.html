<p>Got up about 8 o'clock after a good night's rest in very comfortable &amp; clean beds.</p>
<p>At 11 o'clock went to the English Church belonging to the E: Factory. The duty done by Mr Law, brother of Lord Ellenbro &amp; Chaplin to the Embassy. This church is next to the clubhouse &amp; the interior extremely elegant &amp; neat. The exterior has the appearance of a private dwelling distinguishable from the rest by a statue of Hope on the top</p>
<p>Dined at the lodgings at 4 o'clock that we might get to the gardens of <span class=highlight_yellow>Kres</span><span class=highlight_yellow>tovskiy</span> after dinner &amp; went to the gardens. On our way caught in a horrendous shower of rain with thunder and lightning. The gardens not very crowded no doubt in consequence of the wet, which also prevented the people dancing &amp; us of a great deal of amusement. There were their bands, one military in the gardens, but the best was in front of the master of the Hunt House, and a horn band in a boat. This band is composed of a great number of men &amp; each plays his separate note having a horn of one key, it is the finest thing I ever heard &amp; had a delightful effect upon the water. We did not stay...</p>
