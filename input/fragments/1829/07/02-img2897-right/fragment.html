<p>... took a long stroll down the New <span class=highlight_yellow>Ky</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>Prosped</span>, the fashionable &amp; finest street in Pitusby. It is about 3 <span class=highlight_yellow>wests</span> in length &amp; having <span class=highlight_yellow>trus</span> on each side between the froth pavement &amp; road which adds much to its beauty. Returned to our lodgings about 11 o'clock completely knocked up &amp; foot sore.</p>
