<p>A showery morning, but cleared up towards the middle of the day. We set off with the intention of hearing the service at the Casen Church, but loitering on the way, were too late. The church however was open being a holyday &amp; most splendid &amp; gorgeous it is. The paintings of the different saints etc. are very well done &amp; the most magnificent pillars of granite, highly <span class=highlight_yellow>polished</span>, that can be imagined, each if one stone, there are about 100 of them. Here are deposited flags &amp; keys of towns taken from the enemy at what was no little gratification to our pride, not an English colour amongst them. After a long stroll, we returned to res for dinner. Dined at the club. A very small party. Principally gentlemen. Left the table immediately after dinner &amp; walked about the remainder of the evening. Had our grog &amp; went to bed at 11 o'clock.</p>
