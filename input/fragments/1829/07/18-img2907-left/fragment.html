<p>Another lighter came down last night with the remainder of our tallow.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Bob, JG &amp; I went on shore to order some boots etc. Met with Mr Bartholomew. Went with him &amp; had our dinner on board the David. He left by the steam boat for Petersburg at 5 o'clock. Bab &amp; I went with Stephenson to the Butchers to see the beef salted &amp; afterwards took a stroll.</p>
<p>Got in 120 casks of tallow this day.</p>
