<p>... place all the most celebrated Russian Generals and Statesmen are buried there &amp; there monuments are to be seen. But there are none I think particularly striking for their sculpture. Bob &amp; I walked <span class=highlight_yellow>viv</span> our return home as far as the market near the <span class=highlight_yellow>Casan</span> church in search of beads in imitation of coral for the Lees, saw some, but could not drive a bargain. Came away without them. Took a <span class=highlight_yellow>d</span><span class=highlight_yellow>rogt</span><span class=highlight_yellow>y</span> home, more than a mile. <span class=highlight_yellow>Dined</span> for 60 <span class=highlight_yellow>Kapelles</span> = 6 English. Dined at Mr Websters. Mr <span class=highlight_yellow>Lendglig</span> joined us.</p>
<p>After dinner took a <span class=highlight_yellow>drokty</span> to go to the theatre, but not with an adventure on the way. Made a call &amp; bestowed our charity, thankfully received. Lots of gratification. Found our way to the ____ theatre, a dismal place &amp; very dirty. The painters brush &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>mutton </span><span class=highlight_yellow>fals</span><span class=highlight_yellow> or gash</span> much required. The performance very fair &amp; music excellent.</p>
<p>Got to our lodgings about &frac12; past 10 o'clock. Took a glass of grog &amp; turned in. Pretty considerably tired</p>
