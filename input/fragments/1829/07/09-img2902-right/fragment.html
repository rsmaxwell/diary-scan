<p>... intended for the foreign ambassadors when the court is there.</p>
<p>In the grounds we took lunch &amp; at the same time had the pleasure of being most unmercifully bit by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>From this we drove to Parlousky another Palace the residence of the late <span class=highlight_yellow>Dowagn</span> Empress the widow of Paul &amp; mother of the present Emperor. It is a handsome building but nothing splendid in its appearance. The interior we did not see. The grounds though not as extensive, I think more beautiful than Jarskoi. There is more variety of scenery, hill &amp; dale nature has dome much for it. The other is <span class=highlight_yellow>obliged</span> to ask. In these grounds are some very fine statues &amp; near the Palace is one of the most splendidly executed things I ever saw, these female figures upon a pedestal in marble as large as life, <span class=highlight_yellow>supposing</span> an <span class=highlight_yellow>usn</span> a <span class=highlight_yellow>ne</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>plas</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>lettra</span><span class=highlight_yellow> of statuary</span>.</p>
<p>After taking some brandy &amp; water at the top of the waterfall to quench our thirst, we again got into the carriage &amp; drove homewards, stopping at a fine fountain on the road where we dined, having carried what <span class=highlight_yellow>prog</span> &amp; drinkables we wanted with us.</p>
<p>When at Jarskoi we saw the Emperor's cows, pastures and fine animals &amp; the breeds of all nations. This establishment the late Emperor Alexander took great delight in, and it is kept up at considerable extent. The cows are dressed the same as horses &amp; in fine condition.</p>
