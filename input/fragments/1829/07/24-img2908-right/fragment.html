<p>Fine weather but still a fresh westerly breeze, which detains us. Relieved from pain by the flannel &amp; hartshorn, but my face still much swollen. Remained on board &amp; upon the mole head all the morning.</p>
<p>Mr Bookers clerk called to demand 15 rubbles brokerage for the copper. Went on shore at 5 o'clock to see him upon the subject. It appears I treated with a broker &amp; nob the merchant or I supposed, the brokerage therefore due. Desired Mr Booker to request Mr Hubbardth to pay it &amp; I should settle it in London, having no Russian money left. Amused ourselves on the mole head all evening</p>
