<p>Another fine day &amp; continuance of hot weather. Bob &amp; I after breakfast again sallied out in search of lodgings &amp; were fortunate enough to see Mr Lindsay. A the wonder of his quarter. The house in kept by a yorkshireman of the name of Webster, a horse dealer. Here we succeeded in getting two rooms at 2 rubbles a night, in the larger one which I propose taking, having a small bed in for John G<font color=#BFBFBF>abraith</font> my bed is concealed by a large screen which when drawn round it, leaves the other part of the room for us &amp; answers the purposes of a breakfast parlour.</p>
<p>J Galbraith arrived  this morning by the steam boat &amp; Mr Webster brought him up to the lodgings. Bob &amp; I went to the office &amp; got our passports returned. We afterwards accompanied Mr Lendsay who got our names put down at the Club formed of English &amp; German merchants much upon the same plan as the clubs in London, tis a large building, formally the residence of a nobleman upon whom the Quay principally occupied by English merchants. The suit of rooms very splendid &amp; most elegantly furnished. Here after changing, we dined &amp; always intended doing so when not otherwise engaged. The company being Saturday, was not numerous, but we sat down to a very handsome dinner which I understand cost about 2 &frac12; rubbles</p>
