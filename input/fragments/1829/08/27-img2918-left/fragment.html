<p>Turned out between 6 &amp; 7 o'clock &amp; soon afterward got underway. Still blowing hard from about the WSW lasting at 12 o'clock &amp; after it blew a perfect hurricane, however we rode well &amp; I slept very sound. A large Garth that we saw to leeward of us yesterday without his main topsail, is this morning upon the Maplin sand, having no doubt missed stage last night. Several smacks near him. This <span class=highlight_yellow>lide</span> we worked up as high as Southend &amp; brought up glad to get into such a good roadstead. At 6 o'clock, low water, the gale heavier &amp; night coming on, we did not think it prudent to get under way. At 8 o'clock we had a warm glass of Hollands &amp; water which we enjoyed. The first we have had for some time, having run out of coals.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that yesterday while we brought up abreast of the Whitaker, we lowered our boat &amp; went on board the Eliza of South Shields, Captain Young who kindly supplied us with two or three baskets of coals &amp; a cask of water in return we gave him a spare for a topgallant studding sail boom in dial plank &amp; a bottle of Hollands.</p>
<p>He also took a box of Russian slippers &amp; a keg of caviar, to return to us in London. We fearing the officers might seize them</p>
