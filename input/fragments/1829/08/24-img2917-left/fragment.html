<p>Still blowing very hard from I believe the WSW. About 9 o'clock a most tremendous squall came off the land, a perfect hurricane, enough almost to throw the masts out of the ship. But fortunately it did not continue over &frac12; an hour. It changed the wind however to WNW when a number of the ships immediately began to get under way. Although continuing to blow hard &amp; having a very unsettled appearance.</p>
<p>It was the contention of the master to have gone on shore &amp; brought what previsions &amp; water he wanted but the change of wind &amp; other ships getting under way, colliers like, he must follow the example &amp; at 10 o'clock having first been on board the Duke of <span class=highlight_yellow>Cla</span><span class=highlight_yellow>r</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ian</span> &amp; borrowed a bag of bread, we also up anchor &amp; ran out of the gateway. But we had not been long outside before we repented, for it came on a heavy squall, blowing &amp; raining like fury &amp; very thick. We however kept all our canvas standing excepting the mainsail &amp; continued our course to the SW. Towards evening the weather clear &amp; more moderate &amp; at 8 o'clock, having reached Orford <span class=highlight_yellow>refs</span> wind about W by N we bore up &amp; ran into Aldeburgh roads where we brought up for the night in a snug roadstead.</p>
<p>Many other ships following our example. Blew a cloud, <span class=highlight_yellow>discasted</span> a glass of grog &amp; turned in before 10 o'clock</p>
