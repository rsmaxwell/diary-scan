<p>A fine clear day, but still blowing hard from the westward.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Bob the Captain J Galbraith &amp; I landed. One of the fishermen's yawls (large size) fine sea boats &amp; safe &amp; sailed up to Gothenburg where we spent the day in seeing the town, which is much better than I expected &amp; larger, the country around entirely rock, having a novel wild &amp; beautiful appearance altogether being interspersed with valleys &amp; rivers which were the only spots that could be cultivated &amp; were made the most of. They had one of their annual fares which lasts eight days, but did not seem well attended. After having had our dinner at one of their inns, considering the country very comfortable, we again embarked at 4 o'clock&amp; the winds being against us, we had a <span class=highlight_yellow>turning</span> passage of it, &amp; did not reach the ship until near 8 o'clock.</p>
<p>And after having our tea blowing a cloud &amp; discussing a glass of grog, turned in before 10 o'clock</p>
