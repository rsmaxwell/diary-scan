<p>... the stateroom scuttle light, wet my bed &amp; I did not expect to have had one to sleep in tonight, indeed had the gale continued I should not have cared about it, but I contrived by placing canvas between the bed and sides of the vessel to fortify it pretty well from the wet &amp; thus gained a better nights rest than I anticipated.</p>
<p>My face beginning to swell again, but no pain.</p>
