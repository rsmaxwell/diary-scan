This is one of the richest and most beautiful islands that can be imagined. It is in fact a perfect garden &amp; to us had all the appearance of a gentleman's park. The soil is good &amp; exceedingly productive yielding as much in one season as would keep the inhabitants several years. A boat came out to us from the shore &amp; we purchased of them four ducks &frac34; score of eggs &amp; 2 pounds of butter for which we gave only 6/6</p>

At &frac12; past 8 o'clock the captain, Bob &amp; I as usual had our grog &amp; being in the humour, <span class=highlight_yellow>had</span> some supper &amp; had a regular jollification, blew a cloud &amp; got to roost between 12 &amp; 1 o'clock</p>
