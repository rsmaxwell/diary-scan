<p>A very fine morning &amp; clear weather, still blowing fresh from the NW which has continued the whole day, with a heavy sea which has prevented us making more than 3 knots. Amused myself the whole of the day reading Peregrine Pickle. At 4 o'clock pm wind got to W by N. At 5 o'clock pm tacked ship &amp; stood across towards Gothland again. By observation at 12 o'clock lat:55.52 Reefed topsail at 2 o'clock pm</p>
