<p>A cloudy morning &amp; fresh breeze at NNW &amp; N. Employed myself all the morning in drawing. At noon clear weather but still a fresh breeze. <span class=highlight_yellow>Falsterbo</span> light bearing WNW distant 8 miles. A large fleet of ships passed us upward bound. At 5 o'clock tacked ship a little to the southward of <span class=highlight_yellow>Moea</span> Island after which it became quite calm until 9 o'clock when we got a light air from the NNW. Afterwards most favourable. At 10 o'clock after our grog we turned in, the ship proceeding quickly towards Drags in the island <span class=highlight_yellow>Verf</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>Amag</span></p>
