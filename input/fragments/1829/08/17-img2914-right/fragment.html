<p>Got up this morning much disappointed at not finding ourselves within 20 miles of land, which we should have been had the wind continued as it was last night. But unfortunately it has changed in the night to NW &amp; NW by W &amp; we are now only going 3 knots. The weather fine, but cloudy. Hope we shall have a change before night for I'm anxious to land at Shields.</p>
