<p>... made ourselves decent &amp; comfortable Bob &amp; I walked up to George in the Red Lion Square where we made &amp; enjoyed a hearty dinner of pigeon &amp; veal pies &amp; cold <span class=highlight_yellow>mullion</span>, discharged a good glass of punch &amp; returned to Chambers. With the <span class=highlight_yellow>appearance</span> of Mrs <span class=highlight_yellow>Furmedye</span>, Bob's <span class=highlight_yellow>laudress</span>, I made myself a good perch for the night with Bob's <span class=highlight_yellow>mallrafs</span> in the corner of his room, turned in &amp; enjoyed an excellent nights rest, although the bed was rather a hard one.</p>
<p>Thus ends our Petersburg voyage which upon the whole we have enjoyed, but we could have dispensed with the tumultuous bad weather we experienced. Thank God we have got back safe &amp; without any accident worth mentioning to the ship.</p>
