<p>Spent a miserable night, having had little or no sleep. Looked  out about 5 o'clock. The gale as heavy as ever &amp; without any appearance of change, although the sky very clear. At 11 o'clock Masskand Castle in sight distant about 4 leagues, when we determined no longer to contend with the winds but bore away for Gottenburg &amp; in the course of half an hour those wise few that did not follow our example at &frac12; past 3 o'clock we reached Wings sound &amp; before 5 o'clock brought up in the harbour of Warga, a small channel between two docks, rejoicing with the prospect of obtaining a good nights rest. </p>
