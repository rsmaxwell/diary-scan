<p>A fine clear morning, but wind not at all abated, about WNW &amp; the night has been so boisterous with rain, that the master &amp; all the vessels in company have not thought it prudent to move. The people employed in sending down the Royals &amp; setting up the short topgallant masts. Seeing about board a ship near us, we were in no little alarm, lest it should be one of the preventative service &amp; were in a devil of a brush to get our goods and challis stowed away. It however proved a false alarm, being only a pilot boat. Got under way at 12 o'clock &amp; turned to windward with a fresh breeze. At 9 o'clock pm brought up abreast of the hook of the Gunfleet for the night</p>
