<p>Got up this morning at a little before 8 o'clock after a very boisterous night, the wind having increased to more than half a gale with a tremendous sea, right aft so that we made good way, though at the sacrifice of our comfort. Everything above &amp; below being wet &amp; in confusion. At 5 o'clock this morning a tremendous heavy sea pooped us, stove &amp; carried away our jolly boat &amp; alarmed us so much fearing it had stove in the dark lights &amp; if it had so happened we of course should have been waterlogged. Knowing the delicate state of the <span class=highlight_yellow>archboard</span>, where she was making a great deal of water, the fear of another heavy sea striking us kept me in a very uncomfortable state the whole of the day. Towards evening however both wind &amp; sea fell considerably. We have been going today from 6&frac12;  to 7 knots. Ship laboured very much &amp; made a deal of water. We consider we have got this evening considerably to the westward of the Naze of Norway, say 50 miles.</p>
