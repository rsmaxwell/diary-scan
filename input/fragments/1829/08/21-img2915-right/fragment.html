<p>Got up at &frac12; past 7 o'clock. A fine morning. Most moderate weather. Wind N by W night after Studdington set Just passed the Floating light, having made good way during the night. Had a good night's rest, but much plagued with the rheumatism</p>
<p>Passed Cromer at 1 o'clock with less wind Between 8 &amp; 9 o'clock in the evening abreast of Harborough endeavouring to get through the gateway, but falling calm were driven back by the tide. With much trouble got the ship head round to the westward &amp; a light breeze springing up, stood a crop to the land. At 10 o'clock went to bed. Tide turned &amp; the captain intending to work up to Winterton &amp; anchor, the wind being from the SW.</p>
