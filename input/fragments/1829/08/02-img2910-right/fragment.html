<p>Got up at our usual hour. Finer weather, wind NE &amp; strong sea, but still cool. At noon by observation lat:57.8N  Wind WNW. The strong sea preventing us making more than 2 or 3 knots. Read service &amp; lessons for the day. In the afternoon wind NW &amp; blowing fresh, only going from 3 to 4 knots. A few ships in company. Amongst them Bowies Malvina. At 4 o'clock took in top gallants sails. Bob &amp; I very tired of this slow work.</p>
<p>Between 9 &amp; 10 o'clock finished a couple of glasses of warm grog &amp; turned in hoping to sleep better than last night. The tallow casks making a most infernal creaking. Obliged to get the state room port light caulked, a pretty considerable quantity of water having come in &amp; wet my bed</p>
