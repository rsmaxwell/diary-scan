<p>A damp morning wind SSE. Turned out very wet. Wrote to William. Wind changed in the afternoon to SE. Found myself very queer this morning in consequence of late hours &amp; last night at the Dales. Stayed in the house all day. In the evening at the newsroom &amp; called at the Mulstrum &amp; gave Bennett a <span class=highlight_yellow>turn</span>.</p>
