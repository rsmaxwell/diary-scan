<p>Good Friday. A most beautiful morning. Wind NW. Did not go to church in consequence of poor Robert Brown's death. On board the Hope. She got the remainder of her coals down &amp; sailed this afternoon. Towed out by a steam boat, the wind being from the SSE. Dined at home &amp; afterwards went with H Harry to Mr Sadlers at Whittle Point to take wine in the evening at <span class=highlight_yellow>Nancy</span> Jervis</p>
