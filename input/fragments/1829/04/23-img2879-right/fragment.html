<p>Another cold morning. Wind easterly. Walked to Tynemouth. Dined with J Tinley. In the evening called upon Mr J Young &amp; had a long conversation both with him about taking our dividend without surveying. Also he did not seem so determined in his opposition. He desired me to see H Dale &amp; talk to him.</p>
