<p>A continuance of cold weather &amp; ENE wind. Dined at home &amp; afterwards went with H Harry &amp; R Peart &amp; drank whisky on board the Ardineaple  steamer Captain Cunningham. On our return when the boat reached the shore, Cunningham stumbled &amp; falling upon me, we both rolled overboard. Got a good dunking.
