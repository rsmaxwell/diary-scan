<p>A dull morning after a very heavy fall of rain during the night. Wind NW. After breakfast Kit &amp; Joe went to see the Lambleton hounds throw off at Flags &amp; James, Kits servant, drove me in the gig to Durham, where I had to remain all day, the coach not passing through till evening. Showers during the whole of the morning, but in the intervals I strolled about to see all my old haunts etc. Things much in a &quot;status quo&quot;. I could perceive few alterations or improvements. Called upon <span class=highlight_yellow>SKeene</span>. At 8 o'clock took a gig &amp; got to shields at &frac12; past 9 o'clock &amp; went to the whist club for an hour. Received a letter from William.</p>
