<p>Another beautiful morning. Wind about West. Went over the water with H Harry to see Mr S Walkers patent lever to the old windlass worked, but it was unshipped. Wrote to C <span class=highlight_yellow>Kirkmond</span> about the price of <span class=highlight_yellow>mineral</span> timber. Mrs Dixon down to see Mrs Scott, rather more gracious than before. She invited me to Benton.</p>

Drank a couple of tumblers of whiskey toddy with Allen &amp; went to the theatre to see Madam Vestris perform <span class=highlight_yellow>Latit</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ea</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>Har</span><span class=highlight_yellow>og</span> in the <span class=highlight_yellow>Billes</span> <span class=highlight_yellow>Shala</span><span class=highlight_yellow>g</span><span class=highlight_yellow>e</span><span class=highlight_yellow>n</span> &amp; Apollo in Midas.
