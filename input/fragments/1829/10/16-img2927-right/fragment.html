<p>A fine morning, rather cloudy. Jow &amp; Kit out with the hounds. I went out shooting &amp; walked about the whole of the day. Killed only one bird. Dined at home &amp; in the evening Joe &amp; I went to Mr Kell's at Lanchester (the <span class=highlight_yellow>suryion</span>) with whom we drank tea &amp; played a few rubbers. We got home about &frac12; past 1 o'clock in the morning</p>
