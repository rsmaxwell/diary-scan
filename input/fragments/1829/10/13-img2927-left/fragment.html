<p>A dull morning having been a good deal of rain during the night. Wind about SSW. We breakfasted with Mr G Greenwell at ____, a party there to hunt. Went out with the harriers, but I did not follow them having a fair commanding view from the top of the hill. They had a plenty of running &amp; found a great many hares, but being several plantations they made their escape into them. Turned out very well. We all returned &amp; dined at Lanchester at C Lumley's public house. Sat down nine to dinner. In the evening played whist, A very stormy night. A deluge of rain. Continued playing until 3 o'clock in the morning in the hope it would clear up, instead of which, the rain was so heavy that the river overflowed its banks &amp; covered the green so that we were compelled to remain all night.</p>
