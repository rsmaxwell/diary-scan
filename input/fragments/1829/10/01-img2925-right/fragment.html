<p>A beautiful morning. Wind WNW. Received a letter from William &amp; another from Richmond putting off my visit until Thursday next. Went over to South Shields &amp; called upon ____. Received the butcher for William. Returned &amp; took a walk to Cullercoats. Dined at home at 2 o'clock. The children sailed this afternoon. At the whist club in the evening.</p>
