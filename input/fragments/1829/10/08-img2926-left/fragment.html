<p>A very stormy morning. Exceptional wet &amp; heavy sleet showers. Wind about N. Got breakfast early &amp; took the steam boat to Newcastle &amp; at 10 o'clock got into the Express coach &amp; went to Durham. When we arrived a little after 12 o'clock Richmond had sent his man and gig for me but by some mistake the man supposing I had not come, returned to <span class=highlight_yellow>Burn</span><span class=highlight_yellow>hopeside</span> without me at &frac12; past 12 o'clock. I therefor started &amp; walked out to dinner.</p>
