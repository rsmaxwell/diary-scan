<p>A beautiful day &amp; very mild. Wind about WSW. Went out at 10 o'clock with the hounds, harriers. Kept by Joe Richmond. Not much sport, being a bad scenting day, found three or four hares but only killed one.  Joe mounted me upon his favourite mare, Daphne, an excellent hunter. She carried me beautifully &amp; I performed wonders, taking several leaps without a &quot;spill&quot;.  A Mr <span class=highlight_yellow>Wylane</span> joined us &amp; stayed for dinner. Rich <span class=highlight_yellow>Grunwell</span> &amp; a Mr Potts came in to wine &amp; we spent a pleasant evening. Joe is now  enabled to keep the hounds at <span class=highlight_yellow>Burnhop</span><span class=highlight_yellow>e</span><span class=highlight_yellow>side</span></p>
