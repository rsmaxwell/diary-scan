<p>Another beautiful mild day. Wind about West. Got up this morning.  Very stiff and aching from the exercise of yesterday. Mr Richmond, Joe &amp; I walked to Lanchester Church. Heard the service &amp; saw the natives. Returned home by the Greenwells of the Ford. Saw Mr White &amp; family of Woodlands at church, <span class=highlight_yellow>lops</span> kindly invited us to dine with him next week. Dined at 3 o'clock without company. Took a stroll after our wine, spent a quiet evening &amp; got to bed early</p>
