<p>A fine morning. A hard frost. Wind E by S. Has been a little snow in the night. Last night the <span class=highlight_yellow>mews</span> room was on fire but was discovered in time to get put out before much damage was done. In a short time it would broken out &amp; spread that the whole building would have been destroyed. The floor rafters and ceiling of <span class=highlight_yellow>mews</span> room partly burnt. Walked with Boswell to Tynemouth. Dined at J Dales. Met a large party &amp; spent a pleasant day.</p>
