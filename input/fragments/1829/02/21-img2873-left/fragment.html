<p>A fine morning. Wind SW At 10 o'clock am wind suddenly changed to SE with thick fog &amp; very raw and cold. Went to Newcastle by coach but could not get anything for the Hope. Called at Mrs Dixon's. Dined at home. In the evening at the whist club at A Dales. Received a letter from J Young demanding payment of their claims upon W &amp; J Scott which we shall most certainly not accede to, he having agreed to take the <span class=highlight_yellow>comporation</span> with the other creditors.</p>
