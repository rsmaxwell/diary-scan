<p>A cold morning. Wind SW. Has been some rain in the night. Received a letter from the committee of the Hope Club ordering us to get a new <span class=highlight_yellow>lamp</span> &amp; next winter a new foresail. Also now four new ballast shovels. Engaged all the morning writing to William &amp; the Galbraiths. Found Mrs Craig in a chaise &amp; went to <span class=highlight_yellow>Walls</span> to dine with Mr J Wright, a large party of 18. Spent a pleasant day &amp; had the best port wine I ever tasted in my life. Got home at 12 o'clock.</p>
