<p>A mild morning with the appearance of rain &amp; blowing fresh at WNW. Mrs Scott in a devil of a humour blowing every person up right &amp; left. I think her mind must be affected. Went to church. Took a family dinner with A Harry. In the evening at the Mulstrum. Met Bell Jervis for the first time.</p>
