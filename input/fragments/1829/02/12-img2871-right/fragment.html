<p>A mild morning, but damp having been a great deal of rain in the night. Wind NW. A meeting held of the committees of clubs to demand an explanation of Joe Elder for fixing his ship below the rates of freight determined upon by shipowners. <span class=highlight_yellow>It is</span> not the first time he has been guilty of such dishonest practices. He could not <span class=highlight_yellow>explain</span> himself &amp; unless Mr Bell cancels the charter, which will be known tomorrow, Eldess ships will be turned out of the clubs, the proper way of treating such fellows. Dined at home. In the evening attended the whist club &amp; afterwards went to a large bridal party at Tom Wrights</p>
