<p>A fine morning. Wind West. Tom Smith &amp; I went to Church. Afterwards called at Mrs Marr's who would not let Emma go up to Newcastle to see Bell Smith. The King by Lodges paper a little better back still in a very precarious start. Dined at home. Pscous to which I Smith left. Walk to Tynemouth in the afternoon &amp; took wine &amp; tea with Libbs</p>
