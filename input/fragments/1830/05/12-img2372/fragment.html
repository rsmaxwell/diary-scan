<p>Fairer and warmer weather. Robert Ilderstow &amp; I had an early breakfast &amp; rode over the river till below Hedghey, where we fished until it began to rain when we took shelter at a mill &amp; then walked up to Rosea an estate of the Ildestonn's.  Had tea &amp; eggs &amp; rode home in the evening, when we found Mrs Crosby &amp; Mrs Strothard had arrived from Newcastle on a visit. Had better sport today, brought home a few good trout</p>
