<p>Wintery weather and blowing strong from SE. On board the Hope people engaged with the wind <span class=highlight_yellow>lafe</span> <span class=highlight_yellow>preparing</span> for new barrel &amp; paul bits. On breaking the old barrel off, found the wind <span class=highlight_yellow>lefs</span> sprung &amp; rotten. Obliged to condemn it. Dined at home. In the billiard room afternoon &amp; at the whist club. In the evening  at the Duke.</p>
