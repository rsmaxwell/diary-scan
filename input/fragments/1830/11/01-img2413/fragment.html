<p>A fine morning blowing hard at West. Remained in the house all the morning. Robert went to Preston &amp; saw Mr I Fenwick who agreed to pay an acknowledgment for the drain, the wall encroachment into Arthur's garden &amp; also to take away the railing, thereby admitting the hedge to be the boundary line of which indeed there could be no doubt as to be once wish to make the railings the line which was only permitted to be put up to keep the cattle off the quicks. Dined at home &amp; suppered in the evening with a party at there. A bet lost by Mr Sadler</p>
