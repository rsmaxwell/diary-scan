<p>A beautiful morning. Wind SW. Walked up to the Hope alongside <span class=highlight_yellow>gran</span><span class=highlight_yellow>e</span> getting ballast out. Got her down up the shore at Metcalf dock to sink her to find out the peak. Walked to Tynemouth, saw Potts, who returned with me to Shields. He, Harry, French &amp; I  went to the Albion &amp; Mulstrum</p>
