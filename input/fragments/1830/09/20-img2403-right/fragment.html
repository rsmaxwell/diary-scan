<p>It has blown a gale of wind all night at SW &amp; continuing. The Suffolk Hull steamer was driven upon the rock in coming in last night. Walked to the rock to see the Suffolk. No chance of getting her off. Afterwards walked up to Sadlers at the Point to dinner &amp; spent a pleasant day at the Malstrum in the evening. Got our <span class=highlight_yellow>buf</span> for the ship this morning</p>
