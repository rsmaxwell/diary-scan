<p>A fine morning. A fresh breeze from the West. The Hope upon the shore having been sank did not find any bad places of consequence. The buts ends bolts been in a great many places corroded &amp; heavily worn was the principal cause of her making so much water. Employed getting new bolts put in &amp; the buts ends caulked. Dined at Home. Spent the afternoon at Dr Drury's garden playing at quoits &amp; the evening at the Mulstrum</p>
