<p>Rather a dull morning with a continuance of SE wind. &amp; cool. Tool Emma G up with me in Dunn's coach to Newcastle where we met Tom Smith who drove he home with him to Royston for the whole day. Went in the afternoon to the races. A good deal of company, the Gold Cup being to be seen for; which was won by Lord Elcho's Gondolence. Dined in the Grand Stand. Got home at 11 o'clock</p>
