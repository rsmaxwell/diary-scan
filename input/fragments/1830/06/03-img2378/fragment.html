<p>A dull morning with rain. Wind SSE About 11o'clock the weather cleared up, Harry, Nicholson &amp; I walked with I Richardson in his cable up to Mr Sadlers at the Point &amp; then to Jarrow Slake where we had two hours fishing, but very poor sport, we afterwards landed &amp; dined with Sadler &amp; spent a very pleasant day. It turned out a rainy evening &amp; we had a wet &amp; unpleasant walk home</p>
