<p>A most beautiful day, particularly the afternoon. Wind west, Took a walk with Captain Webb to Tynemouth. Met Smiths, Hannah, I Weston. Webb took her &amp; the <span class=highlight_yellow>Blenkensops</span> on board the <span class=highlight_yellow>Mers</span><span class=highlight_yellow>er</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ard</span> Tatter, laying too off the Castle &amp; gave them a few hours sail to the Sunderland. Dined at home &amp; the afternoon being so fine tempted H Harry, for the sake of the walk to go to the tents on the sands but there was no racing. One match</p>
