<p>Another wet morning Wind West. Walked to Tynemouth after breakfast &amp; saw the soldiers parading. Returned by the fields. Dined at home. Wrote to Fanny Smith that Emma would meet his at Morpeth on Thursday next. Paid monthly money for the Hope to do which I drew on Chapmans for &pound;20. Turned out a wet evening &amp; at bed time it was a deluge</p>
