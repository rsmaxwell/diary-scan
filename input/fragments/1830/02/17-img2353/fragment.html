<p>A fine morning Rather frosty wind fresh at NW. Got up at 7 o'clock and went on board the Hope. The pilot on board but decided to not venture to take her out, it being in bad tide &amp; threw feet sea upon the bar. Received a letter from WBS &amp; one from Tom Lee. Answered Tom Lees. Dined at home &amp; spent the afternoon at the billiard table. In the evening, heavy rain &amp; wind to NNE. At the Duke of York with H Harry &amp; Nicholson</p>
