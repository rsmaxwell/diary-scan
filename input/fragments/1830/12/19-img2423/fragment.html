<p>More moderate &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>rainy</span> weather. Wind W by S. A frost during the night. Did not go to church. Read the service at home. In the afternoon it came on to blow a heavy gale of wind at NW. Many ships got to sea.</p>
<p>HMS Chelders running to go to sea but at blowing hard with a heavy fresh in the river, the ships were quite unmanageable. The first officer on board the cutter &amp; threw to the opposite side of the river &amp; letting go her anchor prevented her going to shore. Some <span class=highlight_yellow>coll</span><span class=highlight_yellow>e</span><span class=highlight_yellow>cse</span> there got foul of her &amp; finally she was prevented going to sea &amp; obliged next tide to move again in her old birth. Dined with J Tenley where the officer was expected but prevented coming.</p>
