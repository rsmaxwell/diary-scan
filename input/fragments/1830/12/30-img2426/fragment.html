<p>A frost this morning but slight. Mark Webb &amp; I set off to walk to Hartley with our guns, but by the time we reached Whetley it began to sleet &amp; rain so <span class=highlight_yellow>heavy</span> that we turned back but got wet before we got home. Dined at home &amp; attended the whist club in the evening. Was engaged to supper at Cheston with Lowrey but being such a stormy night did not go.</p>
