<p>A dull morning &amp; blowing fresh ay WSW. Took a walk to Dr Drurgs garden where we played at quoits. An immense number of people went out to Chistow to meet Mr Hodgson where they took the horses out of the carriage &amp; drew him into town in procession to the George tavern where he  addressed the people in a short speech. I afterwards dined with him. We sat down about 85 to dinner  &amp; spent a very pleasant evening. Mr Ildeston slept at our house</p>
