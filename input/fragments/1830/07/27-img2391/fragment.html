<p>Further most beautiful day &amp; but for a SE breeze would have been insufferably hot. Bathed again this morning. The water in fine order. Walked to Tynemouth. Got home to dinner. Took Wine at the George. Tea at A Harry's &amp; in the evening again walked to Tynemouth. A great many people in the castle yard</p>
