<p>Wind NNW &amp; NW. A most beautiful Day. Breakfasted at the George with Rec Hodgson who afterwards with his friends set off for Blyth where they were to decide with the Premium.  At &frac12; past 1 o'clock, Harry, Drury &amp; I took a boat &amp; rowed up to Sadless to dinner. I Dale also there. We spent a very pleasant day it being his birthday. Took a glass of wine &amp; water with Dale on our return. Received a letter from Fanny Soneth informing us of Emma being rather unwell &amp; requesting if I would allow to stay with them a little longer, which I agreed to.</p>
