<p>A fine morning. Wind WNW Captain Webb &amp; I with the boys went on a boat down to the rocks to fish but had no sport. Whilst there a part of the cliff gave way &amp; falling upon a poor girl who happened to be sitting underneath completely buried. She was soon dug out but dreadfully crushed &amp; quite dead. Her sister was close to her &amp; saw the accident. Returned home &amp; had some dinner at 5 o'clock. Spent the latter part of the evening at H Harry's</p>
