<p>Another fine morning &amp; a very intense frost. Wind about west. Walked with H Nicholson to the Ridges at High Cherton. Had a little scaling, soon tired. Walked round by Tynemouth. Returned to dinner at 3 o'clock. In the evening walked again to Tynemouth &amp; took wine, played a rubber &amp; suppered with Mr Brown &amp; a party at the Star &amp; Garter. Not my favourite. Got home at 1 o'clock. Frost again &amp; a very wet night.</p>
