<p>Beautiful weather, but very windy at West. Received a letter from ABS in reply to their informing him of Mrs Scott's death, saying he cannot leave London before tonight or tomorrow morning Dined at home. Wes &amp; Fanny Smith excessively angry that we should claim the amount of taxes upon the house paid by us in error &amp; which ought to have been paid by Mrs Scott. Fanny inclined to be very violent, her conduct disgusting &amp; very insulting; displaying more regard for the money than for the aunt. Blew a perfect hurricane with heavy rain the afternoon</p>
