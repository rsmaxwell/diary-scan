<p>A foggy morning. Wind NE. Afterwards changed to SE &amp; fine clear weather. Went to Church in the morning. Mr Pemberton accompanied me. I was engaged to dine with I Tealey today but on my return from Church. I found that Mrs Scott was so much poorer &amp; her death expected every moment. I sent an apology. She expired precisely at 9 o'clock without a struggle</p>
