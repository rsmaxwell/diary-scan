<p>A cool morning &amp; blown very hard all day at west. Of course in the house. Fanny Smith again exceedingly violent today. More so than before &amp; insulting. Than I was obliged to speak to her in a way that had the effect of making her silent. Wonder ? Be at opposite William BS did not arrive until after 11 o'clock having called &amp; stopped a short time in Westgate Street. Went to bed from after his arrival.</p>
