<p>A fine morning. Wind NW &amp; rather cold. Tom Smith, his mother &amp; Fanny left us for Foyston &amp; fortunately without any more unpleasantness. After they left us the weather changed &amp; we had a very stormy day, heavy showers of snow Was &amp; I had the servants up &amp; told them of our plans. Robert agreed to remain with me, also Leadbetter. Hutchison of course leaves us, but will stay in the house until she gets a situation or I wish her to leave. Stephenson has been at NCastle  but could obtain nothing for the Hope only 8/6 pecght offering. Ordered Him to unbind the sails. Gave him a draft upon Chapman for &pound;20 to pay wages. At home all the evening</p>
