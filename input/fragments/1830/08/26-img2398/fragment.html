<p>A cloudy morning. Been rain in the night. Wind N to NE &amp; WNW. Turned out a very fine day. Received a letter from J Chapman. William and I went out with our guns &amp; walked to Marsden Rock by the sands. Got to the top of the rock, a man having made steps up. Got a lunch there &amp; on our way home took a few glasses of punch with the sea breeze &amp; Phasine Society who has <span class=highlight_yellow>this tent</span> pitched on the cliffs.</p>
