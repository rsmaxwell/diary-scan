<p>A fine morning with a fresh breeze at E by S. I went to Newcastle in the steam boat. I dined at the rooms at a <span class=highlight_yellow>deueser</span><span class=highlight_yellow> </span><span class=highlight_yellow>geocor</span>. Mr Hodgson then returned home. I stayed all night at Mr Aireys in Eldon Square. A wet day</p>
