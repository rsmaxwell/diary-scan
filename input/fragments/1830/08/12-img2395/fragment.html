<p>A dull morning &amp; blowing fresh from the SSW. Got up early and went to Newcastle by steam. Attended the courts. Dined with Mr Airy &amp; in the evening attended the <span class=highlight_yellow>afsize</span> bath which was a very good one, about 430 people them. Got home to Mr Airy at about 2 o'clock where I slept</p>
