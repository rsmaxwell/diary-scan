<p>Most beautiful weather. Wind ESE. Went by Steamer to Newcastle could get nothing for the Hope. Dined with D Dixon, a party Tom Smith, Mr Busqter; they all went to the theater to see Liston, I looked in but did not remain long, the house very full for his benefit. Got into a gig &amp; returned to Shields</p>
