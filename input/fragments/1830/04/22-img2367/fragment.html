<p>Fine weather blowing fresh at WNW. Received a letter from WBS of his arrival in London &amp; also one from I Smith to say he will dine &amp; stay all night with me on the 1<sup>st</sup> May. Wrote to WBS. Dined at home. Saw Mr &amp; Mrs Ildegton, he very lame with the gout. Spent the evening at Allens, got home at &frac12; past 2 o'clock</p>
