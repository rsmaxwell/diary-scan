<p>Turned the hands up about 5 o'clock being low water &amp; the wind at SSW I got up before 6 o'clock. The people busy getting the anchor &amp; setting sails. Had a fine run during the day down <span class=highlight_yellow>swin</span>, studding sails set but not much wind which varied between <span class=highlight_yellow>SE</span> &amp; S by W. At &frac12; past 8 o'clock at night off Aldeburgh &amp; beautiful clear weather but a strong flood tide against us. Turned in about 9 o'clock</p>
