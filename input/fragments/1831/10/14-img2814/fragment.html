<p>A fine morning but blowing hard from the SW. Gave Robert a draft on executors account for &frac12; years taxes &pound;9.5.2. Paid &pound;20 in executors account from my own. Money advanced me by WBS. Walked out &amp; called on Mr Robson. High Cheston. Dined at home at 5 o'clock &amp; with Bess at night.</p>
