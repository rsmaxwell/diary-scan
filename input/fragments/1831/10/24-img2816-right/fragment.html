<p>Fine weather blowing fresh from the SW. Lockerwood &amp; I walked up to Wallsend &amp; breakfasted with Potts. The hounds after breakfast were taken out. Charlton offered me his horse but I declined it. Laid the hounds on a <span class=highlight_yellow>bag</span> fox. Returned home. Dined with Readhead &amp; at night with Bess</p>
