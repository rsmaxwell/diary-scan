<p>A very fair morning. Wind from SW. Got up early &amp; took Dunn's gig to Newcastle. Took a place in the Alnwick coach at 10 o'clock. Got there before 3 o'clock where most of the officers who intended dining at the mess had arrived. Sat down to dinner at 6 o'clock. Spent a very pleasant &amp; jovial evening &amp; kept it up until 4 o'clock in the morning.</p>
