<p>Turned out at 12 o'clock am. The ship then running with a fresh breeze at SW for the <span class=highlight_yellow>Newrope</span> light which we passed about 1 o'clock &amp; ran through Hasbrough Gateway. Turned into my crib again before 2 o'clock I awoke or rather disturbed at 5 o'clock by a tremendous squall at SW a little to the south w of Cromer with heavy rise. It took us suddenly &amp; without any warning &amp; therefore with all sails standing that they had great difficulty in taking them in. However they succeeded at last in taking them without losing anything, which considering the violence of the squall was fortunate. When they had double reefed the topsails &amp; made all snug I again went to bed. Got up at 8 o'clock still blowing hard from the WSW. We were then abreast of the Dadgrow floating light. It continued to blow fresh all the morning varying between WSW &amp; W by N. After dinner Nicholson &amp; I turned in &amp; had a good snooze until &frac12; past 4 o'clock where we found Flamborough in sight distant probably about 15 miles. Wind &amp; sea very much fallen, but still a fine light breeze from about WSW. All reefs out, top gallant <del>sails set</del> &amp; fore topmast studding sails set. Passed Flamborough Head at 8 o'clock, a most beautiful night. At 9 o'clock we had a glass of grog &amp; I afterwards walked the deck with Nicholson till 12 o'clock when we turned in.</p>
