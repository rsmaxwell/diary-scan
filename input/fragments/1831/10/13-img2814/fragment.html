<p>Beautiful mild weather. Wind in the morning SW. Changed in the afternoon to SSE. Left Benton directly after breakfast &amp; walked out to Newcastle to meet Stephenson who arrived yesterday, fixed the hope to load Bell &amp; Dixons Walls, but won't get coals for upwards of a fortnight. Took the steamer to Shields.</p>
<p>Found a letter from WBS with the Hopes freight account but no note, brokers commission being changed which WBS thought an error. Paid an average Eligible Club &pound;14.9.3 &amp; gave Stephenson &pound;20 to pay wages. Dined at home at 5 o'clock. At the whist club in the evening &amp; with Bess at night. A rainy &amp; blowing night</p>
