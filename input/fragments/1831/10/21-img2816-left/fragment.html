<p>A very fine morning. The air rather frosty. Wind NSW. Left Alnwick by the Wonder coach at 10 o'clock, got to Newcastle before 3 o'clock, took a Shields gig &amp; got home in time to order dinner at 6 o'clock when Cha<font color=#BFBFBF>rle</font>s Redley came &amp; stayed all night. I spoke to Col<font color=#BFBFBF>onel  </font>Colson yesterday respecting the second gazetteer stating that I still considered myself very unhandsomely treated. <font color=#BFBFBF>I</font> showed him the Dukes letter but could get nothing out of him</p>
