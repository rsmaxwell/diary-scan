<p>A fine morning after a very heavy fall of rain during the night. Wind SSW. Afterwards changeable between <span class=highlight_yellow>N</span> &amp; S by E. After breakfast went to Codlings, Stephenson met me there &amp; we got all my luggage on board the Crisis &amp; about 12 o'clock having got all her ballast in, she weighed anchor &amp; dropped down to Greenwich where we were enabled to sail down the reach &amp; we got to Woolwich between 2 &amp; 3 o'clock. The tide here low we took the ground &amp; there remained until 10 o'clock at which time I had gone to bed but the ship got under way &amp; beat down to earth &amp; brought up between 1 &amp; 2 o'clock in the morning</p>
