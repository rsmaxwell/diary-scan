<p>A letter from WBS</p>
<p>A mild morning. Wind SW. A party of us went to Cullercoat Sands &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>found</span> ourselves at Rifle &amp; Pistol shooting at a target. Lunched at the castle &amp; at 4 o'clock dined with J Redhead &amp; Lockwood at the lodgings. I sent them a pair of soles. At night with Bess</p>
<p>This days papers brought an account of the Reform Bill being thrown out of the Lords by a majority of 41. The debate did not conclude till &frac12; past 6 in the morning. Much excitement in London.</p>
<p>A rainy afternoon &amp; night</p>
