<p>A very fine morning. Wind West. After breakfast walked to Tynemouth &amp; with others. Amused ourselves on Cullercoat Sands practicing ball firing. Dined at home at 5 o'clock.</p>
<p>Wrote to Mr Archer last night the owner of the planter to meet me at 11 o'clock on Tuesday morning to survey the damage.</p>
<p>With Bess at night.</p>
