<p>We were disturbed again this morning at about 3 o'clock by a heavy squall with rain from the SSW which increased. I &amp; Nicholson immediately turned out, the ship being off the Tees by the time we got upon deck, they had got the top sail &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>missen</span> stowed &amp; top sail reefed,  <span class=highlight_yellow>lay</span> the ship too soon afterwards left with the head to the land, between Seaham &amp; Hartlepool, the squall gradually subsided &amp; at day light 5 o'clock fine weather again. Ran the ship in for the land &amp; between 7 &amp; 8 o'clock got a piolet on board. Lay off the harbour until the tide flowed sufficiently for us to run the bar, which we did at 11 o'clock, working up to the narrows &amp; then dropping up to the <span class=highlight_yellow>Lenickeln</span> shore where I landed &amp; came home. Robert got my things on shore.</p>
<p>I dined with J Tinley &amp; in the evening called &amp; saw Bess, got home before 11 o'clock</p>
