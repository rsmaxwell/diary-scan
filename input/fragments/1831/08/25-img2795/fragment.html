<p>Most delightful weather. Wind SW. Had a warm bath this morning. At 12 o'clock we all got into a four wheeled vehicle. Drove round the greater part of the island, excepting the north angles, but there is nothing very picturesque or beautiful to be seen. Got home to dinner at 6 o'clock. Ian Basnes dines out</p>
