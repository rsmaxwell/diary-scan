<p>A continuance of fine weather. Amused ourselves by strolling about the markets etc. William went &amp; saw Dr Proctor again, but I being tired did not go. Having settled our bill, at 2 o'clock we again embarked on board the <font color=#000000>Ariadne</font><font size=3.4pt color=#000000>&nbsp;</font>&amp; sailed about 9 o'clock. The vessel most uncomfortably crowded, being about 155 passengers on board. We could not get berths. Passed close by the Island of Alderney. A fine sight.</p>
