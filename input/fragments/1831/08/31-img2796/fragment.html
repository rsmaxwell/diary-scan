<p>A dull morning. Wind SW. Bob Marsh left for London. Received an answer from the Duke referring me to Colonel Coulson. The Duke tied up with the gout &amp; not able to see me. Wrote to Stephenson, Major Falls, Colonel Ogilvie, William &amp; I went to Shirley to dine. Amused ourselves in rifle shooting</p>
