<p>A fine day &amp; blowing fresh from the WNW. I made an attempt to get out of bed this morning but my back was so bad I was obliged to lay down again. Breakfasted in bed. About 1 o'clock determined to make another attempt to get up &amp; dress myself &amp; with much difficulty &amp; pain &amp; the assistance of Ben I succeeded. After being up &amp; walking a short time, found myself much easier. Walked down to the Pier &amp; baths. Had a warm bath &amp; Mr Lee afterwards drove me home in his gig. The remainder of the afternoon &amp; evening found myself much relieved. About dinner time we had a very heavy squall with rain.</p>
