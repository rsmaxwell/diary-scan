<p>We put up at Mousehole Hotel which is near the harbour &amp; the back bed room window commanded an exceedingly fine view of the sea adjacent islands. This hotel I recommend to all travellers both for the activity &amp; attention of the landlady &amp; her daughter Mrs ____ &amp; their reasonable charges. There is a small harbour formed by piers which is dry at low water. The rise and fall is very considerable being I should think thirty feet.</p>

<p>Having changed our cloths &amp; made ourselves comfortable we had breakfast. Much to our surprise met James Basher in the coffee room who agreed to join our party at dinner. After breakfast strolled out to see the town. Much pleased with the new market. Fish &amp; butchers etc. It is the best &amp; most perfect thing of the kind I ever saw or heard of.</p>

<p>Afterwards called upon Dr Proctor who was not at home. Went over &amp; saw the interior of the collage, a very fine institution &amp; apparently well placed &amp; of it were not for the low heavy square towers in the centre would be a handsome building.</p>

<p>During the afternoon saw the <span class=highlight_yellow>presence</span> feast of the town &amp; walked up to the garrison which stands very high upon the south point of the bay which <span class=highlight_yellow>with</span> the town, it &amp; fort completely commands. In our rambles we met with old Charlton late of the firm of Scott &amp; Charlton, who came &amp; dined with us at 6 o'clock. He has lived about a year here. Saw Dr Proctor this afternoon. Much pleased with him.</p>
