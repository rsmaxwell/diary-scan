<p>A most beautiful morning. Wind from the N &amp; E. Got up at 8 o'clock &amp; breakfasted at 9 o'clock. From the noise &amp; tremulous motion caused by the engine I got very little sleep. The boat off Scarborough at 3 o'clock in the morning &amp; landed Mr J Brandling etc &amp; passed Flamb<font color=#BFBFBF>o</font>ro<font color=#BFBFBF>ugh</font> Head at 5 o'clock &amp; the Dadgeon light about 1 o'clock. Dined at 3 o'clock &amp; at the same time off Cromer. It was after 8 o'clock before we got through the Roads.</p>
