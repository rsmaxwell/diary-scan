<p>A dull morning having been rain in the night. Wind fresh at WNW. In endeavouring to throw my portmanteau upon my shoulder, it being very heavy, I strained the muscles of my back very severely &amp; I fear I shall not soon recover from it. Pain very acute. Got on the coach at the White Horse <span class=highlight_yellow>ally</span> at 8 o'clock with WBS &amp; BBG &amp; started for Southampton where we arrived at &frac12; past 4 o'clock having had very fine weather &amp; a pleasant journey, the dust being laid by the rain. My back very painful &amp; with some difficulty got down to my lodgings &amp; to bed. We got Mrs Sands lodgings, the same as when at Southampton before.</p>
