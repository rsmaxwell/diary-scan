<p>A dull morning. Wind SW. We arrived at Southampton at &frac12; past 5 o'clock, very much fatigued having been waiting to sleep or lay on deck all night. After waiting two hours &amp; a half at the custom house, we were obliged to go home to breakfast without our luggage. Dined at the Lewises at Shirley. Colonel Ogilvie &amp; Captain Cobb there.</p>
