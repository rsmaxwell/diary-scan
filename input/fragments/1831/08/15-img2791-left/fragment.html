<p>Turned out at &frac12; past 5 o'clock the vessel a little below the Nore light. A fine morning with a fresh breeze from the NW. Having a strong ebb tide against us, we did not reach Blackwell until about 1 o'clock when J Mitchell RM, Ben &amp; I put all our luggage into a boat &amp; rowed up to the tower stairs, took a coach &amp; drove to Philpot Lane &amp; therein to Nottingham place. Ben &amp; I there walked out. Dined at 6 o'clock <font color=#BFBFBF>at </font>Richmond, Mitchell &amp; Bob Marsh dined with us. With the latter I became reconciled and friendly again he having explained his sorrow &amp; shame at his conduct towards me. This reconciliation has contributed much to the pleasure of my visit to London together with a letter received from Col<font color=#BFBFBF>onel </font> Foswell saying that he will pay his son's debt to me, which may be considered a god send; It will however enable me to pay my expenses &amp; so enjoy my visit the more.</p>
