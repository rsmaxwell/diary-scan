<p>A beautiful day. Wind SW &amp; ESE. Walked to Tynemouth. Ben G<font color=#BFBFBF>ailbraith</font> went to Newcastle to see Emma. At Tynemouth again in the afternoon. Had a most delightful bath at the end of Cullercoats Sands &amp; dined with L<font color=#BFBFBF>ieutenan</font><sup>t</sup> Mitchel &amp; Lockerwood at the castle. Bess met me on the mound, gave her a long lecture but <span class=highlight_yellow>query</span> it has any good effect. Heavy shower of rain</p>
