<p>A most beautiful morning. WBS &amp; <font color=#BFBFBF>I</font> walked down to &amp; called at North<font color=#BFBFBF>umber</font>l<font color=#BFBFBF>an</font>d House. Saw and had a long conversation with Mr Boyle who thought that I had not been well treated. Called &amp; sat with Bob Marsh, went with him to the court of chancery, afterwards had a long wait round by the west end. Towards dinner time we had a tremendous heavy storm of rain, thunder &amp; lightening. Dined with Richardson at 6 o'clock, and in the evening took a boat at Westminster Bridge &amp; went to Vauxhall but did not go in as there were no <span class=highlight_yellow>fine</span> works. Returned &amp; got into the gallery of the House of Commons where we sat until 2 o'clock in the morning. Nothing interesting going on.</p>
