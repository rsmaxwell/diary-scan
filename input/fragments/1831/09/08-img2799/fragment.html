<p>A fine morning. Wind SW. The town all alive &amp; on the move towards Charring Cross, Pall Mall etc. to see Coronation Procession. After breakfast I went out but could not see the procession, so great was the crowd.  It appearing however to be near the United Services Club House after it had passed I saw major Falls who asked me in &amp; upon I had a very fine view of the whole of it on its return. A most splendid &amp; magnificent sight it was. Saw there Majesties very distinctly. Unfortunately there was a great deal of rain which they were in the Abbey which made the streets very dirty &amp; dampt the pleasure of the people no doubt very much. Dined with Bob Marsh &amp; in the evening saw the illuminations which passed good</p>
