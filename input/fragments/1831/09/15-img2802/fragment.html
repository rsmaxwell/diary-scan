<p>A most beautiful morning. Wind N by E. Remained in the house till after 1 o'clock expecting Boswell, but he did not come. Walked round the inner circle of the Regents Park &amp; thence to Bob Marsh's  &amp; WBS &amp; I afterwards walked up by Regents Street home to dinner. Found that Boswell had called after I had left home.</p>
