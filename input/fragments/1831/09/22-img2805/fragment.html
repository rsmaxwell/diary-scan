<p>A fine morning. Wind NW. After breakfast WBS &amp; I went into the city &amp; at 11 o'clock embarked on board the Brocklebank steamer with an immense crowd of people &amp; preceded to Woolwich to see the <font color=#BFBFBF>HMS </font>Thunderer 74 a round ship launched. An immense concourse of people present. The King &amp; Queen arrived about 2 o'clock &amp; soon afterwards the Thunderer slid into the river in most beautiful style, the best launch I ever saw. Afterwards it was a grand &amp; imposing sight. Returned to town &amp; dined at the Blue Ports at 6 o'clock</p>
