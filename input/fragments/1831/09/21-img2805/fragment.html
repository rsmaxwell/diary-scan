<p>... decorated with all their orders, it was a very splendid &amp; magnificent sight. I thought I should have been very nervous, but was not at all so. I was nominally presented by the Earl of Beverley, but in fact by the Lord in waiting who was I believe was Lord ____  <font color=#BFBFBF>Earl of Gosford</font>   I had the honour of kissing the Kings hand. Lord Beverley found me out in the ante room &amp; was particularly polite &amp; attentive. After leaving the Levee, WBS &amp; Bob Marsh were waiting for me &amp; we walked along Pall Mall &amp; I got a coach &amp; drove home where I exchanged my dress &amp; returned to Richmond where I dined</p>
