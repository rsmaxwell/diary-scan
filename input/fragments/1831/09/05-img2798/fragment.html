<p>A fine morning. Wind SW &amp; warm. Took the Paddington Stage into the city. Went to the office, nothing there, at the Coal Exchange. Saw there Brown &amp; Fenwick. Walked out of the city. Called upon Bob Marsh, strolled round by Pall Mall, St James's Street &amp; Piccadilly to Richmond's to dinner.</p>
