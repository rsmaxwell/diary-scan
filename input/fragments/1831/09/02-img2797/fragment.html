<p>A fine clear morning. Wind NW but cool. After breakfasting with Mr Lee, got upon the Red Robin coach driven by Pearce at 10 o'clock &amp; started for Town where we arrived at &frac14; before 7 o'clock travelling a new &amp; by far the more beautiful road, over the Hog Back. Here we had a drenching shower of rain &amp; hail, through Guilford to town. Got to Nottingham Place at 7 o'clock. Had a cup of tea &amp; went to bed at 10 o'clock</p>
