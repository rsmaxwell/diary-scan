<p>The early part of the morning dull &amp; thick, afterwards cleared away &amp; turned out a fine day. Wind SSE. Got all my luggage into a Hackney coach &amp; down to Philpot lane (there saw Stephenson, the Hope being at Greenwich <del>got up to stone stairs</del>) down on St Catherine dock &amp; the Crises having got out, I <span class=highlight_yellow>proceeded</span> &amp; left all my luggage at Lodlings. Walked up again to Phillpotts Lane, accompanied WBS to Guildhall and having got a Beef Steak at Jewps on WBS, Lee &amp; I walked down to Mr Carr's &amp; drank tea. Called at Codlings &amp; saw H Nicholson who had got the ship down to Duke Shore &amp; expecting to get away in the morning. I determined to accept Mr Carr's offer of a bed. Set WBS part of the way up the Commercial Road. Returned with Nicholson to Lodlings &amp; got to Mr Carr's a little after 10 o'clock. Rained very heavy with a great deal of lightning. Part of the Hope sold today.</p>
