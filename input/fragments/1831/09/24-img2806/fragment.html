<p>Another fine morning. Wind WSW. H<sup>y</sup> Harry called upon me about 12 o'clock. After lunch we went to the Baker Street Bazaar to look for a gig for Sadler, but did not purchase. Got into a cab in Oxford Street &amp; drove to the Pantechnicon  in Belgrave square, a very splendid large building lately erected for the sale of Carriages etc. etc. An immense number of vehicles of all sorts. One of which a new dennilt we brought for Sadler for &pound;30, a very cheap bargain all that it will want will be two or three coats of varnish in a few months. Returned to Nottingham Place to dinner. H Harry left us a little after 8 o'clock in an omnibus.</p>
