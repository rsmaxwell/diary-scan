<p>Another delightful autumnal morning. Wind north. Received a note from H Harry to say they called upon me this morning. A little after 1 o'clock, he, Miss G Hurry &amp; Miss Fenwick called &amp; we drove to the Zoological Gardens. Afterwards to the Coliseum with which we were much delighted &amp; astonished &amp; most particularly with the Swiss Cottage &amp; arcade. Thence we drove to Walworth &amp; I dined with them. Walked home in the evening where I found a note from Lord Beverley saying he will have much pleasure in presenting me to His Majesty on Wednesday next.</p>
