<p>A beautiful day. Wind from the N &amp; E. Wrote a letter to Lord Beverley &amp; afterwards called upon him &amp; found him at home, very graciously received. Entered into a long account &amp; related to him all the inconsistencies respecting any complaint about being <span class=highlight_yellow>regazzetted</span> etc, but he could not interfere at the same. Explained himself as not surprised at my feelings &amp; regret that it should have happened, but that he thought no further change could be made. Took a Paddington stage into the city. Called at the <span class=highlight_yellow>courting</span> <span class=highlight_yellow>homes</span> &amp; thence walked down to Mrs Carr's. Saw Boswell the <span class=highlight_yellow>Decgttonte</span> and dined there. Spent the evening &amp; returned by stage at night.</p>
