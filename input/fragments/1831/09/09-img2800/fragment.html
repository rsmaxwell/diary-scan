<p>A very unpleasant day. Rained incessantly. Wind NW. Did not go out until 2 o'clock. Called upon Beverley who was not at home. Left my card. Walked down to Bob Marsh and Richmond's. Got a letter from Stephenson who will not be cleared so soon as expected. Answered it &amp; told him I should not be at Hull &amp; of my intention to leave town on Tuesday by the city of Edinburgh steamer. Called at Hawtry the dentists &amp; got my teeth cleaned. Dined at 6 o'clock at Nottingham Place. Richmond &amp; Bob Marsh dined with us.</p>
