<p><p>A dull rainy morning. Wind NE. Received the Hope's <span class=highlight_yellow>assales</span> from WBS. Took the 11 o'clock steam boat &amp; went to Newcastle. Called to see Emma G<font color=#BFBFBF>albraith</font>. Could learn nothing further with regard to our conversation. All as much in the dark &amp; suspense as myself. Saw Dixon &amp; the ladies in Westgate Street where I lunched. Received of the <span class=highlight_yellow>Hind</span><span class=highlight_yellow>h</span><span class=highlight_yellow>augh</span> &pound;36.0.9 being the difference between what the Hope made &amp; 11/- freight applied. Returned by steam by the 4 o'clock boat &amp; came home to dinner. Attended the club at Tibb's in the evening</p> <p></p></p>
