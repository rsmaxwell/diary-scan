<p><p>A very fine mild morning. Wind WSW. Several light ships got down. Went to Milburn Place to see Mr Stephenson respecting <span class=highlight_yellow>remitting</span> &pound;13.10 to London. Afterwards walked to Tynemouth. Dined at home. At a party in the evening at Mr W Hewson's</p> <p></p> <p>Great confusion &amp; I fear damage in the harbour tonight, the heavy fresh <font color=#BFBFBF>wind </font>having driven the ships adrift.</p> <p></p></p>
