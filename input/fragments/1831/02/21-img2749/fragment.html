<p><p>A beautiful morning. Wind NW. Much disappointed at not finding my name in the Gazette. Took a long walk with Cunningham round by Preston, Whitley, Cullercoats &amp; Tynemouth. Wrote to WBS with an account of <span class=highlight_yellow>units</span>. Dined at Jebbs at 5 o'clock, a gentleman's party &amp; spent a very pleasant day</p> <p></p></p>
