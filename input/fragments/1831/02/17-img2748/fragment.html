<p><p>A fine morning blowing fresh at WNW. Went by the coach to Newcastle. Called at the club house to see Colonel Coulson who had left town in the morning. At D Dixons, saw Dixon &amp; the ladies. Called on young Bigger who gave me the names of the trader men in London who have the regulation patterns. Walked down from Newcastle. Met Dr Drury &amp; Mr Harrison near Mr Robson who were on their way to dine with Saddler at the Point &amp; prevailed on me to accompany them. At the whist club &amp; Mulstrum in the evening.</p> <p></p></p>
