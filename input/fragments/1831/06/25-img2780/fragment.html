<p>A dull cloudy day with showers. Wind variable between NNE &amp; NNW. Received a letter from WBS from Dublin of his intention of being here tomorrow or Monday. Went over the water to enquire about the coach to York. Dined at home. Engaged writing etc. in the afternoon &amp; at the Albion in the evening. A very rainy night.</p>
