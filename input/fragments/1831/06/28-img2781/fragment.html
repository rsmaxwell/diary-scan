<p>A dull &amp; very sultry close morning. Wind N by W &amp; NNW. Called upon Martin Orr at the Garrison. Saw Mr <span class=highlight_yellow>Garb</span><span class=highlight_yellow>utt</span> but declined fixing a foreign mail being expected &amp; the chance of freights being better. H French dined with me on board after having a long walk about the town. The ship out &amp; cleared this afternoon. Wrote to Bess B. Martin Orr &amp; his wife called upon me at the ship. Set H French <span class=highlight_yellow>part</span> of the way home &amp; amused myself the remainder of the evening by strolling round the town. Turned out a very rainy day.</p>
