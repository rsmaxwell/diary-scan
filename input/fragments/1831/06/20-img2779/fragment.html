<p>A fine morning. Wind about West. Gave Roberts a draft for &pound;5 for the house. Got &pound;5 of Chapmans on my own account. H Harry &amp; I took the steamer to Newcastle &amp; walked up to the course. The two last races very well contested. Very little company there <span class=highlight_yellow>ended</span> &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>left</span> from <span class=highlight_yellow>there</span> usual. Dined at the Grand Stand. Walked into Newcastle again &amp; returned to Shields which we did not reach until 11 o'clock having been <span class=highlight_yellow>agreed</span> at St Peter's &amp; 3 &frac12; hours in coming down. At the Mulstrum</p>
