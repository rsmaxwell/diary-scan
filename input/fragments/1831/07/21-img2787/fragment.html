<p>A dull morning. Wind SW. Baker Kop Snowdon &amp; I walked down to <span class=highlight_yellow>w</span><span class=highlight_yellow>aters</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ide</span> to finish, by the time we got there it began to rain heavily, which gave us a soaking. Had but poor sport. Killed about a dozen, not large but fine fish. Returned to dinner at &frac12; past 4 o'clock</p>
