<p>A fine morning blowing fresh at SW. Tom Smith, Dixon &amp; I after breakfast walked to Hauxley &amp; with Major Clatterbuck rowed across in a coble to Coquet Island the first time of my being there much pleased with the trip. The island covered with thousands of birds of the tern species. Returned to Togston by the links &amp; Amble</p>
