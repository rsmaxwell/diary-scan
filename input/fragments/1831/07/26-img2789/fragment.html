<p>Most beautiful weather. Wind SW. Walked down after breakfast to Amble &amp; fish the Granary Stream but without success. Ben G<font color=#BFBFBF>albraith</font> &amp; Rob S<font color=#BFBFBF>mith</font> with me afterwards. Ben &amp; I bathed &amp; then joined Tom at Amble. Looked over his fields there. Turnips in a very bad state. Got home to dinner at 3 o'clock. Mr <span class=highlight_yellow>Ellenth</span> dined with us. Mrs Scott much better.</p>
