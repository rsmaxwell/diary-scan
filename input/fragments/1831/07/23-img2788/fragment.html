<p>A most beautiful day. Ben Galbraith, Rob Snowdon &amp; I after breakfast, set off to fish at the Hermitage. I however turned off to begin at the Granary but the tide had risen too high. Walked up to the mill streams &amp; fished there all the morning. Fanny &amp; Bell Smith &amp; Emma Galbraith came down &amp; joined us &amp; we all dined together at the Hermitage <font color=#BFBFBF>Inn</font>. Fished up the <span class=highlight_yellow>w</span><span class=highlight_yellow>aterside</span> &amp; <span class=highlight_yellow>Morick</span> streams in the evening but had very poor sport. Got home to supper after spending a most delightful day.</p>
