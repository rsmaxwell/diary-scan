<p>A fine morning. Breakfasted early &amp; took the 8 o'clock steamer for Newcastle &amp; at 1 o'clock got upon the coach for Felton where I arrived at a little after 1 o'clock. Had an early dinner &amp; afterwards borrowed a nod of Melrose &amp; had a few hours fishing but little success. Walked down in the cool of the evening to Togston. Got there at &frac12; past 6 o'clock. Found the Clutterbucks dining there.</p>
