<p>A most beautiful morning. Wind with the heat got to ENE. Arrived at Shields at 7 o'clock. Crossed the water &amp; got home in time to go to the Low Lights &amp; bath before breakfast. Dined at home. Being excessively sleepy, turned into bed for three hours. Walked after tea up to Preston through the fields to examine them &amp; see <span class=highlight_yellow>moors</span>. Went to the theatre in the evening &amp; afterwards called at the Mulstrum to see Bess</p>
