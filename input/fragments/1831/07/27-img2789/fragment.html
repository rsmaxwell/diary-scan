<p>Still delightful weather. After breakfast Tom &amp; I set off for Newcastle in his <span class=highlight_yellow>jones </span><span class=highlight_yellow>Auisn</span>. Stopped at Morpeth for two hours. Saw <span class=highlight_yellow>Shapton</span> &amp; got to Newcastle at 5 o'clock to dinner. Saw the High Sherriff, Mr <font color=#202122>Silvertop</font><font color=#202122> </font><font color=#202122>go out accompanied by a very numerous train of friends &amp; carriages to meet the judges. The High Sheriff turned out very handsome. Took a gig in the evening &amp; got home a little before 10 o'clock</font></p>
