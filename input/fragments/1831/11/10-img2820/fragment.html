<p>A raw damp &amp; cold morning. Wind WSW. Two ships got upon the herd in coming into the harbour. Received a letter from Harry &amp;  G of Yarmouth informing me that the Hope had sprung a leak on Sunday night off Orford &amp; got a boat with 14 men to assist in pumping &amp; could scarcely keep her with both pumps going. They however had got her to Yarmouth close to the bar where they were lightening her to get her into the harbour. Laid the letter before the club who sent instructions to Messrs Hurry. I wrote to Stephenson &amp; WBS &amp; also sent a copy of the letter to the Hope Club at Newcastle.</p>
<p>Dined at 2 o'clock. At the whist club in the evening &amp; suppered with Bess. Jobling with me</p>
