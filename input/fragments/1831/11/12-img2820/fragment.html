<p>A fine morning. Wind NW. Received a letter from Messrs Hurry &amp; Co &amp; Stephenson of the ship having struck upon the bar in going into Yarmouth. Wrote to them to deliver &amp; sell the coals, get the leak stopped &amp; return to Shields. Wrote also to WBS. Went across the water &amp; saw Mr Potts who is to send me a copy of the <span class=highlight_yellow>Harmongs</span> protest on Monday. Tom Smith &amp; I dined at home at 5 o'clock &amp; had the whist club in the evening. A pleasant party. Jobling returned late</p>
