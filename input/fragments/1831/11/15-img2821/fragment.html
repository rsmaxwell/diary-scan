<p>A fine frosty morning. Wind W by N. Received two letters, one from Hurry &amp; Co, the other from Stephenson stating the ship to be still very leaky requiring 6 extra men to pumps. They had got her about &frac14; of a mile up the way up to the quay. Laid the letters before the club. Walked to Tynemouth. Dined at home at 2 o'clock. At the billiard room in the afternoon &amp; with Bess at night.</p>
