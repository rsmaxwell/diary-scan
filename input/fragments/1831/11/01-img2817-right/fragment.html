<p>A very fine morning blowing &amp; has been all night hard from the SW. Ob board the Hope. Mr Archer did not come to survey the damage but sent a letter with an estimate, offering me &pound;1.10 &amp; the old boom etc. Walked up &amp; saw him but did not agree, however afterwards determined to take it with an 18 inch plank.</p>
<p>Dined at home.</p>
