<p>A mild day. Wind about west. Walked to Tynemouth with Boswell. Received a letter from Messrs Hurry &amp; co. The coals being all out on Saturday &amp; that they had found the leak to be in an open trennail hole between the timber under the starboard for chain about two feet below <font color=#BFBFBF>the </font>light water mark. Had plugged it up &amp; after heaving down &amp; driving a new trennail, expected she would be able to return to Shields without the necessity of being docked at Yarmouth.</p>
<p>Dined at home. At the billiard room in the afternoon &amp; with Bess at night.</p>
