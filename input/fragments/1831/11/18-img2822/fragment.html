<p>A fine frosty morning. Wind WNW. Having from cold I suppose, the back of my neck &amp; head much affected &amp; sore. I this morning took a black draught &amp; lay in bed till 1 o'clock. Charles Redley called from Hartley. Dined &amp; spent the afternoon with us. He left us at &frac14; past 9 o'clock to walk back being a fine moonlight night. I went along &amp; slept with Bess. Robert yesterday paid Philipson Mason his bill &pound;37 &amp; today paid into Chapman's &pound;15 more rents</p>
