<p>A beautiful morning. Air frosty &amp; glass high. Wind NW.</p>
<p>Received a letter from Wilkinson &amp; Angus saying they could not purchase the carriage.</p>
<p>Walked with Boswell to Tynemouth. Jobling arrived &amp; agreed to stay with me. He dined with me at 2 o'clock. At the billiards room in the afternoon &amp; with Bess at night.</p>
<p>Ordered 2 gallons of whiskey for one of which Jobling paid.</p>
