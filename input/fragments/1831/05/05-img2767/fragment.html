<p>A very fine morning &amp; at last a change of wind having got from the NW. Walked to Tynemouth &amp; from thence by the sands to Whitley Park and called upon Mr J Weight. Wind changes to NNE with heavy showers of hail &amp; rain in one of which I was caught &amp; got nearly wet through.  Returned home to dinner. Spent the evening at home.</p>
