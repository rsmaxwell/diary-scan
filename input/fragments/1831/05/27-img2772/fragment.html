<p>A dull morning &amp; cool wind NE. Went by Dunn's coach to Newcastle with R Reed. Dined with him at the Half Moon House. He left by coach at 4 o'clock for Mr Ridley's near Chester-le-Street &amp; I returned to Shields by steam. Had some whisky toddy at the Albion &amp; afterwards called to see Bess whom I found very <span class=highlight_yellow>uncoale</span> from the <span class=highlight_yellow>brecisex</span> she <span class=highlight_yellow>accd</span> the night before.</p>
