<p>A fine morning but cold. Wind NW. heavy changed from NE from which <span class=highlight_yellow>ash</span> it has been blowing fresh all night with a heavy sea. Dined at home. At Dr Drury's in the afternoon &amp; in the evening went to the theatre, but the house was so badly attended that <span class=highlight_yellow>Kean</span> would not perform. Finished at the Albion</p>
