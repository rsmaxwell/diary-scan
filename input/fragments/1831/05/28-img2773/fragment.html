<p>Another dull morning. The wind still from the old quarter NE. Walked to Tynemouth &amp; saw the troops fire a salute at 12 o'clock in honour of the King's birthday. Returned &amp; also saw the <font color=#BFBFBF>HMS </font>Orestes gun brig do the same &amp; man her yards. Dined at 4 o'clock with Mr Bradshaw in celebration of his wife's birthday, a very pleasant party &amp; most splendid dinner &amp; wines.</p>
