<p>A continuance of fine weather, blowing fresh from the ESE. Dined at home at 2 o'clock. At <span class=highlight_yellow>Bradsham's</span> <span class=highlight_yellow>roping</span> in the afternoon playing at quoits &amp; took coffee in the evening at J Tinley's. Wrote to ask R B Reed of Brandon White House to spend next week with me.</p>
