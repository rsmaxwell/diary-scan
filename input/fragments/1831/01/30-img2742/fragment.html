<p><p>A fine morning &amp; hard frost. Wind NW. Breakfasted at Dixons.</p> <p></p> <p>Afterwards called &amp; saw Mr Turnball who wrote out my declaration of qualifications which I signed &amp; which he will deliver to Mr Thorp the clerk of the Peace tomorrow.</p> <p></p> <p>Called upon &amp; saw Colonel Coulson who was with Captain Bigg &amp; told him what I had done &amp; had some conversation with them. He of course will immediately apply for a captain's course for me which will most likely come down in the course of the work, as the military is to go into training immediately.</p> <p></p> <p>Returned to Shields by steam &amp; dined at home at 2 o'clock. H Harry &amp; Nicholson took wine with me in the afternoon &amp; in the evening I walked to the Mulstrum. Received a letter from WBS</p> <p></p></p>
