<p>Still very unpleasant foggy weather. Wind SSW. Received a letter from WBS. Sent him a copy of Chapmans book for the last quarter, also gave him authority to apply to the Duke for a commission in the Northumbria Militia. Dined at home. Wind freshened at SE &amp; every appearance of bad weather.</p>
