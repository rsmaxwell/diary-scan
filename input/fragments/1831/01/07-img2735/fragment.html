<p>A fine frosty morning. Wind NNW. Thought of going to Newcastle, but received a message from Shanks that he wished to see me on board the Hope having found the <span class=highlight_yellow>stew</span> in a very bad state. H Harry went with me, the stern certainly in a very damages &amp; rotten state, but Shanks thinks he can cobble it up so as to be safe &amp; enable the ship to go a voyage or two until the days get longer.</p>
<p>Dined with Dale &amp; spent the evening at Mrs <span class=highlight_yellow>Dork</span> Metcalf's where there was a large party. Received a letter from WBS enclosing a note at 4 months for &pound;300 which I gave to R Spence &amp; got the old one cancelled.</p>
