<p>A fine wintery morning having been a very heavy fall of snow during the night. Wind WNW.</p>
<p>Received a letter from B B Galbraith. A bill for &pound;6.0.10 drawn by <span class=highlight_yellow>Stodter</span> of the Eligible club presented for payment, but I did not take it up having no notice. Dined at 5 o'clock with J Dale &amp; in the evening attended the ball at the George which was the best we have had for a long time. Got home at &frac14; past 3 o'clock</p>
