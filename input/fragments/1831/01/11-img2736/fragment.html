<p>Another damp morning but likely to be finer weather. Wind NW. At the George tavern a great part of the morning. Mr <span class=highlight_yellow>Ilderton</span> there, with whom &amp; a small party, I afterwards dined. Bob <span class=highlight_yellow>Ilderton</span> &amp; I called at the Mulstrum.</p>
<p>Hope got 3 keels down.</p>
