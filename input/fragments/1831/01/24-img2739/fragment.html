<p>A fine morning. Been a slight frost with a little snow during the night. Wind NW. Sea much fallen, so that I think many ships will get to sea.</p>
<p>Received a letter from WBS with copies of letters written to the Duke &amp; Lord Beverley applying for a commission for me in the North<font color=#BFBFBF>umbria</font> Militia. Answered his letter.</p>
<p>Wrote to <span class=highlight_yellow>Bevor's</span> brother to come down to Shields to make some arrangements with regard to the <span class=highlight_yellow>fasern</span> after seeing J Tinley upon the subject.</p>
<p>Dined at home. Spent the evening &amp; suppered with H Harry.</p>
