<p>A very unpleasant foggy damp morning. A little wind <span class=highlight_yellow>lope at</span> appears to be W.</p>
<p>Wrote to WBS giving him a copy of Chapmans <span class=highlight_yellow>book on</span>. In the afternoon at the billiard room. Wrote to Tom Smith &amp; sent him some <span class=highlight_yellow>tripe</span>. Harry, Nicholas, Drury &amp; Cunningham came home with me in the evening &amp; played a rubber.</p>
