<p>A dull morning blowing hard &amp; has been all night from the E by S &amp; ESE with a heavy sea. On board the Hope. Dined at home. At the billiard room in the afternoon &amp; the Albion &amp; Mulstrum in the evening. Gave Bess a turn, <u>first time</u><span class=underline_double> since</span></p>
