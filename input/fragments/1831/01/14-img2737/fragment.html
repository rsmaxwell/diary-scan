<p>A dull foggy morning but rather frosty. Wind West. Got the <span class=highlight_yellow>buf</span> for the ship of Gibson. This voyage <span class=highlight_yellow>6</span> ____ @ 42/- went on board with the <span class=highlight_yellow>buf</span>. Gave <span class=highlight_yellow>Geo </span><span class=highlight_yellow>Stoss</span> &pound;2 on account. Five more keels came down this morning. At the billiard room in the afternoon &amp; at the theatre in the evening. The last <span class=highlight_yellow>time</span> of the company performing this season. Engaged to dine with J <span class=highlight_yellow>Telbs</span> but did not go, rather unwell.</p>
