<p>A beautiful morning but cool with a NE wind. Got a cask of rum on board the Hope. Ordered the men on shore as they refused to sign articles for less than &pound;3 per month. Stephenson at Newcastle clearing.</p>

<p>Ministries in a minority of eight upon Gen<font color=#BFBFBF>era</font>l  Gascoyne's amendment on the reform bill respecting English members. Attended a meeting at the George tavern called in consequence of the minister being in the minority for the purpose of explaining their determination to support them in their proposed <span class=highlight_yellow>grievances</span> &amp; not to give any candidate a vote until he promises to support reform.</p>
