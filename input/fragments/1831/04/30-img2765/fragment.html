<p>A very rainy day. Wind continues from SE. The election for Newcastle took place. I went to the Guild Hall but I could not get near enough to the hustings to hear any part of the speeches. For Mr Ridley &amp; Mr Hodgson returned without opposition. Lucky fellows. Saw them chained. Had a lunch at the Turf &amp; returned to Shields by Dunn. At the Duke of York &amp; Mulstrum.</p>
