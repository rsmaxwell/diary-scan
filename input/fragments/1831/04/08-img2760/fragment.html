<p>A cloudy morning with showers. Wind blowing fresh at SE. &amp; suddenly changed to SW. With most beautiful spring weather. J Cunningham &amp; I walked up to the Doctors garden &amp; round by Preston when I had some <span class=highlight_yellow>talk</span> with <span class=highlight_yellow>Moon</span>. Dined at home. Dined at home. Took a long walk in the afternoon round by Tynemouth, Cullercoat Sands &amp; at the Albion in the evening.</p>
