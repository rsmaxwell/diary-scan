<p>A dull morning. Wind SW. Afterwards turned out a most beautiful day, wind a little to E of S. Wrote to WBS with a account of rents. Afterwards J Cunningham &amp; I started &amp; had a most delightful walk to <span class=highlight_yellow>Hastley</span> where we dined with C Ridley &amp; walked home again in the evening. But before we reached Tynemouth at 6 o'clock we were caught in a heavy rain &amp; got thoroughly wet. After taking a glass of whiskey Toddy with JC to keep the cold out, made the best of my way home &amp; changed my cloths &amp; finished at the Mulstrum.</p>
