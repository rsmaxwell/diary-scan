<p>A beautiful morning, but cool wind East. Took the 12 o'clock steamer &amp; got home to dinner at 2 o'clock. Walked to Tynemouth in the afternoon &amp; Cullercoat Sands. All immense numbers of people there. H Harry, Cunningham, Jebbs &amp; I took wine together at the Star &amp; Garter. Returned to the Sands in the evening &amp; had some <u>fun</u> there. Got home at 10 o'clock.</p>
