<p>A dull cold day &amp; blowing fresh from NNE &amp; sea coming on. Received a letter from WBS &amp; answered it. Called at Chapmans, Mr Spence declines answering our note, but proposes continuing the <span class=highlight_yellow>loan</span> on my giving a bill upon WBS to have his acceptance, the <span class=highlight_yellow>time</span> to be afterward agreed upon when I secure WBS's answer. Walked up to the ship, all ready for sea, excepting <span class=highlight_yellow>wind</span>. Towed her down to the low end of the town. Dined at home. On board the Mr Shand in the afternoon &amp; at the Mulstrum in the evening.</p>
