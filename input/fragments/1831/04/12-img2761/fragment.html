<p>A most beautiful &amp; mild morning. Quite a summer's day, not a cloud to be seen. C Redley having stopped all night with me, left after breakfast for Newcastle. Wrote to Robert Reed Brandon White House to say I would pay him a visit in a few days. J Cunningham &amp; I again walked by the Sands to Cullercoats . On our return Bess B was waiting on the sands for me. J C went home &amp; I joined &amp; remained with Bess all the afternoon until &frac12; past 4 o'clock when I came home to dinner, after which I had another walk &amp; finished at the Albion</p>
