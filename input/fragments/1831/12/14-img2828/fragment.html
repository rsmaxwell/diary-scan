<p>A fine morning. Wind WNW &amp; rather frosty. Being rather tired from last night's debauch, did not rise till near 12 o'clock. The Hope got her beef on board today, a <span class=highlight_yellow>quey</span> takes of <span class=highlight_yellow>thoor</span>. Dinner at home. At the billiard room in the afternoon &amp; with Bess at night.</p>
