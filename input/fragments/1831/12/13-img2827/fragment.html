<p>A boisterous morning. Blowing hard from the W by S with showers. Went by steam to Newcastle. Two hours &amp; a half in going up. Gave Mr Anderson all the papers for the Hope Club to settle the average. Returned by steam. Dr Drury, Mr C Wright &amp; Ben Wright dined with me at &frac12; past 5 o'clock</p>
