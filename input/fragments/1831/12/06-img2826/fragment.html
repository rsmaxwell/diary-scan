<p>A fine morning, after rain &amp; blowing very heavy from WSW. Went to Newcastle by Dunns coach, called on bell &amp; Brown to let them know when the Hope would be out of dock. Saw Emma Galbraith who was quite well. Returned to Shields by steam. At the ship. Dined with Dr Drury.  At the billiard room in the afternoon &amp; with Bess at night.</p>
