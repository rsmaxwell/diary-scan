<p><p>A fine morning and wind SW. Received a letter from Alnwick from the adj<font color=#BFBFBF>utant</font> Crisp ordering me to join the Regiment. Walked to Tynemouth with the intention of taking a warm bath, but they are not yet open for the season. Returned &amp; went up to the Hope. <span class=highlight_yellow>Repairs</span> nearly finished. At high water they hauled her off the shore &amp; dropped her down to Custom House Quay. Toward the afternoon it began to blow very hard varying between SSW &amp; SSE &amp; increased to a gale which continued all night. Spent the evening at home writing etc.</p> <p></p></p>
