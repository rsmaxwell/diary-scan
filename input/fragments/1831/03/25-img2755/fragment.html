<p>A dull morning. Exceptionally cold. East wind with showers. Attended 10 o'clock drill, but did not go to the pasture. Received a letter from WBS of the safe arrival of the Hop at London, but not able to sell her coals, the <span class=highlight_yellow>proves</span> quite light. Lunched with W Torston. At 2 o'clock parade marched to the pasture &amp; went through the manoeuvres. Returned earlier than usual in consequence of the rain. Dined at the mess. A stranger day, but a small party. The band had a concert at the Town hall. I took a ticket but <font color=#BFBFBF>did </font>not go.</p>
