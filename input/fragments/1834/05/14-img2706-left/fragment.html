<p>A beautiful morning. Mr &amp; Mrs Ilderton drove us over to Ilderton. They stopped to attend Mr Howey's sale. Robert &amp; I went on in the carriage to Benton beyond Wooler. I walked from there to West Newton &amp; fished down the Glen, beautiful stream but had poor sport, being a bright day &amp; water fine. Suppered at Benton &amp; went by coach at &frac12; past 11 o'clock to the GameKeepers Cottage at Ildeston to sleep. Excessively fatigued</p>
