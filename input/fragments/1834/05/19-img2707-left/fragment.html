<p>A fine morning. Wind SW. Saw Mr Thompson of South Shields who would not offer &pound;1000 for the Hope, also Mr Watson &amp; Harrison, the brewer who did  but I declined. Spoke to J Young about the payment of his bill for &pound;100 &amp; he offered to take &pound;50 at present.</p>
<p></p>
<p>R Ilderton came down to dinner &amp; we afterwards went to Shields races which were very good &amp; many people there.</p>
