<p>A fine morning after more heavy rain in the night. Wind SE. Dined at the Pig &amp; Thistle, intended to be beefsteaks to be sent by Jos Elder, but not done in his usual mean way, the beef was so course &amp; tough that was not fit to eat or be sent on board any ship. We were properly treated for condescending to receive a treat from such a man &amp; I blame myself much for going. He took good care not to be present himself. Drank tea at Hurry's &amp; at Tynemouth in the evening. Met Bess</p>
