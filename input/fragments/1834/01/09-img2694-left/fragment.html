<p>An incessant rain since yesterday morning &amp; still continues. Wind from the South &amp; East. Left Richmond's after breakfast in his gig for Denton where I dined &amp; then Charlton drove me to Newcastle &amp; we took the <span class=highlight_yellow>omnibus</span> for Shields. At the club. Rope received from Mr Paxton for WBS &pound;30 &amp; gave it to me</p>
