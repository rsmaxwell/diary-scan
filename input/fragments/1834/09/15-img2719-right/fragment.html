<p>Delightful autumnal &amp; harvest weather. Wind WNW. Went with H Hurry by steam up to the Regatta at the Kings Meadows. Never was out in a more beautiful day. A most lively &amp; animated seem, the river covered with boats &amp; the banks with gaily dressed people &amp; carriages. Finished at the Albion &amp; H Hurry's</p>
