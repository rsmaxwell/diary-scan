<p>A dull damp morning &amp; blowing hard NE. Received a letter from Mr Apedaile begging money <span class=highlight_yellow>&amp; </span><span class=highlight_yellow>Merro</span>. Done too much for them already, been ruined by my actions. Dined at house. Went in the evening to Billy Purvis' theatre. The bespeak of the Tynemouth Bachelors &amp; a good house. At Southerns</p>
