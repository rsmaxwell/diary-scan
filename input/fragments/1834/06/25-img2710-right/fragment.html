<p>A fine morning. Wind WSW. Sailed round to the Haven &amp; walked back. Dined at 2 o'clock. The steward of the St Hilda called, having brought Mr Baskes home &amp; gave me good account of BB Galbraith. Saw Mr Pletts. Out fishing for an hour with the doctor. Came on a very wet night. Finished at H Harry's</p>
