<p>A dull morning. Wind SW. Tom Smith drove Robert &amp; me to Felton <font color=#BFBFBF>where </font>we got upon the coach &amp; drove to the Race course. The sport very good. Mr Ord with Tomboy   won the gold cup again, having won it last year. Captain Potts won the Walls<font color=#BFBFBF>en</font>d Harrier Cup. Mr &amp; Mrs Dixon drove me out to Benton where I dined &amp; stayed all night.</p>
