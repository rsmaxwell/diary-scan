<p>During the whole of last night we had a heavy sea &amp; foul wind blowing WSW very hard, to contend with but fortunately a fine boat under us. As it was low water when we started, we overtook to steam Office packit at anchor, at the Rock not able to proceed for want of water, having left 2 &frac12;  hours before us so that after all, I lost no time, no thanks to the rascally clerks at the coach office. We kept company all night &amp; after a tedious passage arrived at the custom House quay, Dublin at 3 o'clock PM. Took my luggage to Mackens Hotel, Dawson Street where I stayed all night</p>
