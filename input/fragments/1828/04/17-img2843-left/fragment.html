<p>... upon reflection, I am resigned and convinced that I have been spared a great deal of painful feeling distress &amp; misery by not having witnessed her suffering &amp; tis a consolation to find that she has had so many kind &amp; attentive friends about her, particularly one Mr Vernon, whose conduct both to my poor sister &amp; myself I shall I trust never forget or be ungrateful for. He insists upon my staying at his house &amp; his great anxiety id to console &amp; make me comfortable. Poor little Emma has fortunately been at Captain Butlins at Broomville &amp; the boys at school. Poor children, they are too young to be sensible of the irreparable loss they have sustained. But I trust that god the father of all will spare &amp; enable me to supply the place of their dear parents they have lost. John J Baker came up to see me in the evening</p>
