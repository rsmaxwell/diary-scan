<p>A pleasant day. Wind still from the North. Did not go to church. Read the service at home. Received a letter from William remitting a &pound;50 Bank Post bill. Took a long walk with Mr Vernon along the Athy road &amp; returned to dinner at &frac12; past 5 o'clock. The boys again with us. W W Fishbrown called upon me</p>
