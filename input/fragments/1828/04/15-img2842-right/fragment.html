<p>Much annoyed at finding I should not get to Liverpool in time to catch the Post Office packit for Dublin. Deceived by the people at the coach office. Left Leeds by coach at &frac12; past 5 o'clock. Outside a cloudy morning, soon began to rain &amp; continued very heavy all day. Reached Huddersfield at 10 o'clock. I think where I had to wait an hour &amp; change coach. Got to Manchester at 1 o'clock &amp; found to my surprise &amp; vexation the coach would not proceed until 5 o'clock. Kicked up a row at the office, got part of any money returned &amp; fortunately caught a coach about to start for Liverpool where I arrived at 6 o'clock &amp; immediately embarked on board the &quot;Bereuenyham&quot;  steam boat which as luck would have it, was that evening going to start for Dublin.
