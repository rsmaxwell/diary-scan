<p>A little rain in the morning. Wind WSW but afterwards turned out a beautiful day. Wrote to William. Called upon Mr Jameson. Had a very delightful drive in the afternoon to Broomfield.  Found the Butlers &amp; Emma quite well, a very affecting meeting, my feelings quite overpowered un &amp; I blubbered like a child, but I could not help it.</p>
