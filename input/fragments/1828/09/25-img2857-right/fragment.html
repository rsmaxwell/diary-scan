<p>A glorious day. Not a cloud to be seen. Wind SW. After breakfast Lewis, Fanny, Bob Marsh took a boat &amp; sailed round to Brading Harbour. Much pleased with the views of the country &amp; coast &amp; delighted with our sail. Got back at &frac12; past 3 pm. Received a letter from William of the arrival of the Hope but too late for yesterdays market.</p>
