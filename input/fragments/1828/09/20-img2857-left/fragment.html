<p>A beautiful day. Wind SE. After breakfast Rebecca, Mrs Lewis, Lee and the girls &amp; I went in the Isis to Portsmouth on board the Melville man-of-war. Captain Hill &amp; much gratified &amp; pleased with the beautiful order she was in &amp; after lunching with Mrs Hill, returned to Ryde, delighted with our sail. The 1<sup>st</sup> Lieutenant got his promotion this day after 21 years hard service.</p>
