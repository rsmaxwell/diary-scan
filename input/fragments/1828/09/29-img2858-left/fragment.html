<p>A fine day. Wind SW. Went into the city by a Paddington Stage. Saw William. Attended the market &amp; afterwards went down the river and dined on board the Hope. Walked home in the evening on our way drinking tea with <span class=highlight_yellow>blephant</span> at <span class=highlight_yellow>Cocksham</span> <span class=highlight_yellow>street</span>.</p>
