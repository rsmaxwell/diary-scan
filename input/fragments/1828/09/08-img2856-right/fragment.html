<p>A fine day. Wind ESE blowing fresh. Took a walk after breakfast with Captain Lewis &amp; Marsh across the <span class=highlight_yellow>D</span><span class=highlight_yellow>a</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ffers</span> to the wood from which is a very magnificent  view. Played a few games at billiards with the Captain. Spent the evening as usual at Navarinos</p>
