<p>Delightful weather. Wind SE. Sea quite calm. Captain &amp; Mrs Lewis, Bob Marsh &amp; I took a boat &amp; amused ourselves four hours fishing. Quiet <span class=highlight_yellow>success</span> having caught 89 what they call whiting <span class=highlight_yellow>pacets</span>, a small fish. Took a walk on the pier after dressing &amp; dined at Navarino. The two young Wainwrights dined with us</p>
