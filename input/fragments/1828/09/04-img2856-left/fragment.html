<p>A beautiful day. Wind NE. Changed to NW &amp; N with thunder &amp; lightning &amp; apparently heavy rain in Hampshire, but returned to the old quarter at night. F Barclay left us this morning for London. Sorry to loose him, a pleasant fellow. Mr Lee &amp; Laura in the chaise &amp; the rest walked to Binstead to see the abbey of which there is little remaining, after lunching on the grass with difficulty &amp; getting our feet covered with mud. We returned home by the beach.</p>
