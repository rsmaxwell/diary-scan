<p>A most beautiful day. Wind SW. Went to church in the morning &amp; heard a very poor commonplace sermon from a <span class=highlight_yellow>Rev</span> Moors. Walked upon the pier in the afternoon. Mr &amp; Mrs <span class=highlight_yellow>Gve</span> Lee &amp; Miss Jane Lee dined at Navarinos. Wind changed with <span class=highlight_yellow>a</span> some rain at night</p>
