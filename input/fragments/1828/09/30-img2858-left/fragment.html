<p>A dull morning during the day showers of rain. Wind SW. Walked into the city. Brought a new hat of <span class=highlight_yellow>Oliphant</span>. Paid &pound;3 for the Hopes ballast &amp; took a Greenwich boat into the pool to her. Gave the mate charge for the passage to Shields. Returned to the city &amp; had a basin of turtle soup at Bleadens. Afterwards took a Paddington Stage &amp; went with William to see the Zoological Society garden in the Regent park. Well worth the walk. In the evening went to the Argyle rooms &amp; was much amused with <span class=highlight_yellow>Fumtas</span> chin</p>
