<p>A beautiful day. Wind SW to W. After breakfast walked to Binstead parsonage, about 1 mile, from Naravinos. In my opinion the prettiest &amp; most picturesque place in the island. The grounds laid out with great taste &amp; kept in the highest order. The views from them very fine. Wrote to William of my intention to be in town on Sunday.</p>
