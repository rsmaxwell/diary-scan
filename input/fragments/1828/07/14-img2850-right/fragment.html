<p>A deluge of rain which continued all day. Left Liverpool for Leeds at 5 o'clock where we arrived about 6 o'clock. Poor Emma much annoyed by an eruption on the skin with great heat &amp; itching like the nettle rash from the heat &amp; sickness on board the steam boat. Took tea &amp; slept at Greaves</p>
