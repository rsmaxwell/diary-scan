<p>A pleasant day. Wind WNW. Engaged in the morning drawing &amp; on board of ship. Sails all on shore at Mr Hearns. Ordered the running rigging to be taken to Mr Sharps, as there's nothing safe on board from the nightly visits the thieves pay. Thus ends the year, a very poor one for ship &amp; owners. I for one can safely say that I have not made one farthing. I only hope the next year will be productive of more good or I know not what will be the consequence. Dined at home &amp; in the evening attended the theatre. The <span class=highlight_yellow>bespeak</span> of the Subscriber to the Assemblies. A very fair house, as things <span class=highlight_yellow>are</span>.</p>
