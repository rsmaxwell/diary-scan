<p>A little rain in the morning. Wind W &amp; SW. A pleasant afternoon. Dined on board the Combatant, Captain Barnes. A ship of the Tinleys, an agreeable party consisting of J Tinley, A Harry, Mr Boswell, Captain Webb, W Barnes, Mr Richardson &amp; self, went to the play at &frac12; price to pass an hour but returned home at 10 o'clock at which hour Mrs Scott had made up her mind I should be in. Her conduct towards me so pointed &amp; bad that I have determined to go to lodgings as I neither have nor do I wish to give her any annoyance at the same time. I don't choose to submit to it myself, for it seems her temper &amp; disposition neither to be happy &amp; comfortable herself or to let others be so.</p>
