<p>A fine seasonable day, rather cold &amp; frosty. Wind S by W. On board the Hope all the morning. Along side the crane getting manure <span class=highlight_yellow>oetts</span> for which I received of Mr Fenwick &pound;2 there being 80 tons. The people engaged unbending sails &amp; taking down <span class=highlight_yellow>running</span> rigging for preparing to laying ship up. Dined at home. In the evening at the whist club at Tom Weights</p>
