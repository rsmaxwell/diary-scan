<p>A very unpleasant &amp; raw cold day. Wind SSW. The Hope got all her coals today, but being thick weather and poor prospect, did not go to sea. Mrs Matthews &amp; Miss Liddell drank tea with us. Gave Stephenson &pound;8. To my astonishment a writ of arrest was opened against me by Bland, Dunn the tailor partners . Very unhandsome conduct as William had called upon him to settle the account before I left town.</p>
