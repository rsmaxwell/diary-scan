<p>A fair day. Wind W. Received a letter this morning from William of Frys &amp; Chapmans failure which <span class=highlight_yellow>satisfied </span>me <span class=highlight_yellow>much</span>, the consequence  was a <span class=highlight_yellow>run</span> upon Chapmans <span class=highlight_yellow>uses tls</span> here, but which I believe ended towards the evening. The bank are otherwise not affected by Frys failure having known for a fortnight it to happen &amp; consequently preparing for a run, they suffer no losses. At the theatre in the evening. Much amused.</p>
