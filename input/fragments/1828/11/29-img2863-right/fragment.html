<p>A dull day. Wind ESE. A few light ships got in. Finished a long letter to William a continuation to that which I forgot to put into the post on Thursday &amp; enclosing Turner's letter from Carlow, sent them off. Dined at home. Attended the whist club at Mr Allens. A very wet afternoon &amp; night.</p>
