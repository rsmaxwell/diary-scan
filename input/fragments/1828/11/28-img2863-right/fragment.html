<p>A fine mild day. Wind about West. Attended a meeting of the Commissioners under the new act to appeal against the rate of the House in Dockwray Square &amp; got it reduced from &pound;50 to &pound;45. Took a walk with Emma &amp; showed her the glass exhibition. Received a letter from William. No account of the Hope. Drew upon Chapmans for &pound;5 for self.</p>
