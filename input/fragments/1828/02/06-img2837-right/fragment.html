<p>A beautiful day. Wind SW. Changed towards evening to East. Engaged all morning on board the Hope. Having two men employed in overhauling small ropes running rigging to which we found in a much better state than could be expected. Mr Carr late master must have been very careless to say the least, having left some sails, bread, flour &amp; bags &amp; a cask of provisions with the head knocked in &amp; compass as on board which were all destroyed &amp; rotten</p>
