<p>A fine day and frosty, Wind WNW. Got the fore rigging over the mast head &amp; the main mast out &amp; found it much decayed both foot and head &amp; fear we shall be obliged to have a new one. Ordered a new bowsprit of Morton &amp; Thompson. Dined at home &amp; spent the evening with N Bird</p>
