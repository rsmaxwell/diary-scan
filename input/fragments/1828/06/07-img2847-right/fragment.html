<p>The first thing in the morning called upon Mr Carmichael but being engaged made an appointment with for 1 o'clock. Walked down to see the guard returned at the castle. Much to my surprise, met captain <span class=highlight_yellow>flu </span><span class=highlight_yellow>ie</span> Butler. At 1 o'clock saw Mr C<font color=#BFBFBF>armichael</font> &amp; then went to Mr Stocks the Proctor who filled up a form for the children to sign that they are willing. I should administer (in my opinion very inconsistent), sent it off by post to Mr Vernon. Dined at Mackens</p>
