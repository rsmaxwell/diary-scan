<p>An exceptionally hot day. Attended the Master again for him to look over draft of support, when he thought it would be better to appoint me sole guardian. I cannot make up mind to take in so much trouble difficulties &amp; anxiety that I feel very unhappy. Cannot stand it much longer. Dined at Mackers</p>
