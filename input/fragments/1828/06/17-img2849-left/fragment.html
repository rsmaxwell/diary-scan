<p>Another hot summers day. Called at Mr Carmichael's &amp; from the difficult situation in which I am placed, determined upon asking my brother to come to Ireland &amp; going to Carlow tomorrow there to remain until I either see him or have a letter from him in answer to one I wrote this day. Wrote also to Mrs Scott. Dined at Mackers &amp; went to the Lyching in Hospital Gardens where there was an unsence assembly of company</p>
