<p>Left Carlos at &frac12; past 7 o'clock in a car &amp; went to Athy to breakfast in 1 &frac12; hours being 11 &frac12; miles. Saw Captain Pope respecting the property there, but could learn nothing satisfactory. He said it was a divided property. His father having 2/3 one of which he sold &amp; the other 1/3 was the Galbraeths &amp; to prove it was a divided property he said the Galbraiths had granted a lease of their part consisting of an old house now in ruins &amp; a tanyard in the rear. He further said that the original lease had somehow or other got out of his hands, but that I could see it at Mr Warrens, Jarvis Street Dublin. That he would be glad to give me every information &amp; assistance &amp; allow me to see all papers that are in his possession. Returned to Carlow in the afternoon. Dined alone. Mr Vernon having gone to Coopers Hill &amp; went to a pleasant quadrille party at Mrs Whilliam Fishbourn. We kept it up until 3 o'clock</p>
