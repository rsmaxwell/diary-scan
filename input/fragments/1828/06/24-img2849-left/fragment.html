<p>A beautiful morning. This being a holy day at the Court of Chancery, we could do nothing. I therefor went in the steam boat to Kingstown &amp; dined with J Thompson on board the Royal Charlotte. The Mayor of Anglesey came down &amp; took a sail in his yacht the Pearl. Lieutenant M  Paget came on too and the Royal Charlotte to whom I was introduced. No great honor as it is not likely he will know me again.</p>
