<p>Called the first thing upon Mr Carmichael. Attended the master at 11 o'clock at the Four Courts. Damm the law say I. My patience is exhausted, got nothing done this day, for want of an affidavit that there were no other next of kin having but Mr Falkener &amp; ourselves. Dined at Mackens. Suppered at the Steades with Ian Gale</p>
