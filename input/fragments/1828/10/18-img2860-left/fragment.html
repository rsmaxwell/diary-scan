<p>A fine mild morning. Wind WNW. After breakfast, Emma &amp; I walked to see the new colliery sunk by Tom Smith &amp; others &amp; afterwards went down to Amble &amp; the sands &amp; returned about 2 o'clock after a most pleasurable walk. Tom, Fanny, Anna &amp; Bell returned from Alnwick to dinner at 5 o'clock</p>
