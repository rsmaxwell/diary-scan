<p>Still fine weather. Wind SW &amp; SSW. Went down to the Hope, only to do 10 &frac12; chat today. Dined on board. Walked up &amp; went to Drury Lane Theatre to the pit at full price &amp; saw &quot;A curse for the <span class=highlight_yellow>Hunt ach</span>&quot; &amp; XYZ. Very much entertained.</p>
