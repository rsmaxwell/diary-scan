<p>A most beautiful morning. Wind NNW. Left Shields at 8 o'clock am after breakfast &amp; got to Newcastle at &frac12; past 9 o'clock. Received a letter from William before I left Shields of the arrival of the Hope, but not sold. Wrote to J Fenwick of Preston Villa from Newcastle what William says about freights for <span class=highlight_yellow>Elgin coals</span> &amp; also sent J Tinley the part of the letter relative to <span class=highlight_yellow>N Birds</span> debts to W &amp; JS. Then left Newcastle at 10 o'clock by the Alnwick coach &amp; got to Felton about 2 o'clock. The day much changed, being very cloudy &amp; beginning to rain at &frac12; past 2 o'clock. After having some lunch, started for Togston to walk in the rain &amp; arrived there at 4 o'clock. Found only Mrs Smith &amp; Emma Galbraith at home. The rest of the family in Alnwick to attend the Jessions Ball. 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup> voyages received for manure &pound;3.17.6</p>
