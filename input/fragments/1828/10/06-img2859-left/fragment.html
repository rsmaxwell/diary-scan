<p>About 7 o'clock got bound. Flamborough Head at 10 o'clock. Off Robin Hoods bay blowing hard with squalls at 11 o'clock between the bay &amp; Whitby met a fleet of London vessels. Blowing hard. Nearly run down one vessel owing to his own obstinacy or keeping a bad lookout. Stowed trysail &amp; main sail &amp; took in jib. Very dark ahead. At 12 o'clock or little after it, clear weather but continued to blow off Hunt Cliff Foot. Turned in for the night.</p>
