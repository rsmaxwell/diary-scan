<p>A very wet morning. Wind WSW. Cleared up towards the middle of the day &amp; turned out a fine afternoon. Went down to the ship about 1 o'clock pm. Found her nearly out. Watt came on board. Sailed about 3 o'clock &amp; got below Woolwich &amp; brought up, where Watt left us. A breeze springing up got underway again about 9 o'clock against the flood but obliged again to let go our anchor about 11 o'clock for want of wind! For the night William slept on board. Brought today a life preserver for 18/- Some white &amp; coloured neckcloths for &pound;2</p>
