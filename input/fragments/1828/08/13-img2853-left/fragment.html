<p>Got up between 9 &amp; 10 o'clock having a slight cold &amp; a little rheumatism upon me. A fine warm summers day we have had for the last five weeks. Wind about south, but little of it, between 10 &amp; 11 o'clock. The United Kingdom steam ship passed us bound to London at &frac12; past 11 o'clock. When off Orford the [wind] changed to the east, a fair wind, but we want a little more of it. I hope it will continue. The breeze continued &amp; we got down to the south end of the Middle Sand where we brought up for the night, not being able to run through the Shoe Hole in the dark. After we got to bed, the wind increased &amp; blew hard with a heavy swell, a great many ships around, which gave us a foul berth extremely dangerous in that part should a gale come on from the ESE. &amp; cause of the loss of so many ships and lives we had in the March gale about five years ago.</p>
