<p>A beautiful day. The Hope got safe down from the spout having taken in 13 keels &amp; 6 char. The remainder followed her down &amp; we got to sea about &frac12; past 1 o'clock PM wind about NE but very little of it so that we did not get much beyond Sunderland before dark. Gave Richardson &amp; Davidson notice of appeal against the land tax for the property in Shields &amp; Preston. Wrote to William</p>
