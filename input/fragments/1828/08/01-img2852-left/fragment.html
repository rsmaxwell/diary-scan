<p>A fine day. Cloudy with wind SW Several ships got to sea in the morning. In the afternoon a few light ships got down after a 12 days passage amongst them the Hope, went on board at &frac12; past 4 o'clock, when off the Black Middens &amp; got her papers. Went to Newcastle &amp; fixed her for Carr's Walls before 6 o'clock either on my own account or 10/- freight, optimal to give an answer tomorrow.</p>
