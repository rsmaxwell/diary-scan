<p>A Beautiful day. Wind SW Went into the city this morning by the Paddington stage about 80 fresh ships got up to market, 2 or 3 of Carr's Walls? The coals bear such a bad character on the market that we could not sell any of the Hope's cargo. Walked out of the city, called upon Bob March, dined at the Blue Ports &amp; took wine in Nottingham Place</p>
