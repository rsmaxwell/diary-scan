<p>A hot day, wind west. Went into the city by a Paddington stage. On the market,  coal lower. Walked out of the city. Dined at 6 o'clock with Mrs <span class=highlight_yellow>Whenbury</span> in Gower Street; a quiet party only Richmond there. He &amp; I went in the evening to Vauxhall Gardens to meet Bob Marsh, Vincent &amp; William. A great many people there, but of the inferior classes. Got home between 1 &amp; 2 o'clock.</p>
