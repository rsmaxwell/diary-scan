<p>A dull morning. Wind SW with rain during the day. Bob March breakfasted with us. Went to the chapel in Vere Street. I afterwards walked round by Gower Street &amp; called upon the Lumleys, they [had] gone down to Stanmore for the day. Continued upon and saw the Linskills in York terrace, Regants Park. Walked round by Hyde park, very little to be seen. Town exceedingly dull. Took a beef steak at the Blue Posts in Cork Street &amp; drank wine in Nottingham place</p>
