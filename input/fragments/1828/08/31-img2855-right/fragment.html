<p>A pleasant morning but rather cloudy. Wind NE. F <span class=highlight_yellow>B</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ar</span><span class=highlight_yellow>cl</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ay</span> &amp; I got up early &amp; bathed. Started after breakfast &amp; travelled along undercliff &amp; saw the <span class=highlight_yellow>difficult</span> <span class=highlight_yellow>gentlemans</span> <span class=highlight_yellow>seats</span>. Most beautiful &amp; somewhat well wooded &amp; cliffs very grand. Stopped at Blackgang Chine, immense high cliffs with waterfall, continued our journey through a beautiful &amp; well cultured country to Freshwater Bay, where we had lunch about 4 o'clock. Captain Lewis &amp; the ladies went by land to see the Needles. F Barley, Bob Marsh, WBS and self &amp; two servants went by water &amp; got very well to the Needles which with the cave &amp; majestic chalk cliffs, were very grand. But our return was attended with much unpleasantness to say the least, having an ebb tide &amp; strong wind against us &amp; being in a bad and cranky sea boat, we all got most uncomfortably wet by the spray of the sea. With much difficulty got back to Freshwater Bay to an 8 o'clock dinner. This is a very <span class=highlight_yellow>r</span><span class=highlight_yellow>eti</span><span class=highlight_yellow>r</span><span class=highlight_yellow>ed</span> &amp; pretty place</p>
