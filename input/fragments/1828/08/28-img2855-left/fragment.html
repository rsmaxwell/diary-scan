<p>A glorious day. Wind east. Got up before 7 o'clock &amp; bathed. Breakfasted at Mr Leer at Navarino House. At 11 o'clock went on the pier to see the Regatta, but dull work, being small boats. Dined with Mr Lee &amp; afterwards attended the Ball at the Library, a very poor one &amp; company bad. Not a pretty girl in the room.</p>
