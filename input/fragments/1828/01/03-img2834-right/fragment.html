<p>Went to Newcastle by coach to see Dixon Dixon for the purpose of having some conversation with him, respecting his promise of assisting me, but it being Millington Colliery pay day, he was so late in returning home I had no opportunity of speaking. I however invited myself to dine &amp; stay all night tomorrow. Got home to dinner at 5 o'clock Fine day &amp; cold. Wind NW</p>
