<p>Again at Newcastle. Saw J Smith Senior &amp; Junior: the old gent: very kind, asked me to dine, &quot;no go&quot; entered upon the subject of the Ariel, showed them W S Brewer's accounts, they seemed to be of our opinion &amp; against any arbitration. Dined with Dixon, had a long conversation about his assisting me. He was extremely kind in his expressions, but said it was out of his power, from his heavy advances to others &amp; having heavy payments to make himself to but that he would consider about it. memo: Its what I expected, not much disappointed. A promise ought to be held sacred. Cold day with rain afternoon</p>
