<p>A fine spring morning. On going out, found the harbour in dreadful state of confusion &amp; much damage done in consequence of the immense land floods driving the ships adrift. Rode to Newcastle with J Tinley, saw W Chapman. He offered to take my bill at 6 months with another approved name to it, for 1000 or 1200. Refused &amp; dined with J Tinley. Wrote to William. Wind SW. Many ships got to sea.</p>
