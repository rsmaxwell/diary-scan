<p>A fine day. Wrote to Mr Digan about the house in Dublin Street that I could give him no decisive answer. Hired a car &amp; drove up the mountain &amp; saw H Fitzmaurice about the bonds, who promised as soon as he could raise money upon his estates to pay them &amp; that on Sunday sennight he would give me some money on account of the interest, perhaps sooner. Returned to Mr Vernon to dinner</p>
