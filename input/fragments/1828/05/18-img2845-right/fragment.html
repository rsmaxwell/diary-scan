<p>A very foggy damp morning. Wind East. Got up early &amp; went by the steam boat to Kingstown to see Tom Thompson on board the Royal Charlotte Yacht. He was much surprised too when I went on board. I spent the day &amp; dined with him &amp; returned to Dublin by steam in the evening. It turned out a fine afternoon</p>
